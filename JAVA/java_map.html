  <li>Prior to the Java SE 8 release, the Java date and time mechanism was provided 
    by the  java.util.Date, java.util.Calendar, and java.util.TimeZone classes, as 
    well as their subclasses, such as java.util.GregorianCalendar.
  </li>
  <li>These classes had several drawbacks, including:<br/>
  - The Calendar class was not type safe.<br/>
  - classes were mutable, could NOT be used in multithreaded applications.<br/>
  - Bugs in application code were common due to the unusual numbering of 
    months and the lack of type safety.
  </li>
  <li>JDK 8+ add conversion methods between java.util and java.time:<br/>
  - Calendar.toInstant() converts the Calendar object to an Instant.
  - GregorianCalendar.toZonedDateTime() converts a GregorianCalendar instance 
    to a ZonedDateTime.<br/>
  - GregorianCalendar.from(ZonedDateTime) creates a GregorianCalendar object 
    using the default locale from a ZonedDateTime instance.<br/>
  - Date.from(Instant) creates a Date object from an Instant.<br/>
  - Date.toInstant() converts a Date object to an Instant.<br/>
  - TimeZone.toZoneId() converts a TimeZone object to a ZoneId.<br/>
  </li>
  </ul>
  Java 9 <a href='https://www.infoq.com/news/2017/02/java9-cldr-ldml'>REF</a>
  <ul xxxsmall zoom >
  <li>A number of parsing and formatting changes have been incorporated in Java 9 to 
bring the functionality closer to Unicode Locale Data Markup Language (LDML). 
These changes have been supervised by Stephen Colebourne, creator of the popular
 date-time library JodaTime, precursor of the new java.time component in Java 8.
Abiding by the Unicode standard will provide better interoperability with other
non-Java systems.</li>
  <li>
    LDML is the language used by the Unicode Common Locale Data Repository (CLDR), 
    a project of the Unicode Consortium to gather and store locale data from 
    different parts of the world, enabling application developers to better adapt 
    their programs to different cultures. Among other things, LDML deals with dates,
    times, and timezones, and more particularly with date formatting and parsing. 
    The following is an extract of new features coming in Java 9 that bring java.time 
    closer to the LDML specification:
    <ul>
      <li>JDK-8148947, DateTimeFormatter pattern letter ‘g’: the letter ‘g’, as 
        specified in LDML, indicates a “Modified Julian day”; this is different from a 
        normal Julian day in the sense that a) it depends on local time, rather than GMT,
        and b) it demarcates days at midnight, as opposed to noon.</li>
      <li>JDK-8155823, Add date-time patterns 'v' and 'vvvv’: ‘v’ and ‘vvvv’ are LDML
        formats to indicate “generic non-location format”, e.g. “Pacific Time”, as 
        opposed to the “generic location format” with specifies a city, like 
        “Los Angeles Time”.</li>
      <li>JDK-8148949, DateTimeFormatter pattern letters ‘A’, ’n’, ’N’: although LDML
        doesn’t specify formats ’n’ and ’N’, it does specify ‘A’, but the current 
        behaviour in Java doesn’t match that of the spec. ‘A’ is meant to represent the
        total number of milliseconds elapsed in the day, with variable width, but 
        currently Java treats this as fixed with: if ‘AA’ is specified as a pattern, it
        will fail to parse any value that is further than 99 milliseconds in the day. 
        ’n’ and ’N’ are just Java extensions to the standard to represent nanoseconds 
        within the second, and nanoseconds within the day, respectively.</li>
      <li>JDK-8079628, java.time DateTimeFormatter containing "DD" fails on three-digit
        day-of-year value: similar to the previous problem, but with ‘D’ representing 
        days within a year. If one specifies “DD” as a pattern, it will fail to parse 
        “123” as the 123th day of the year.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>As previously mentioned, a better alignment with the LDML will ease 
interoperability across systems, since there are multiple technologies that 
have adopted the LDML to some degree. Microsoft .NET uses LDML for general 
interexchange of locale data, and there are packages available for Node.js 
and Ruby, just to mention a few.</li>

      Annotations can be applied to declarations of: classes, fields, methods, other program elements. 
      When used on a declaration, each annotation often appears, *by convention*, on its own line.<br/>
      As of the Java SE 8 release, annotations can also be applied to the use of types. A few examples of where
      types are used are class instance creation expressions (new), casts, implements clauses, and throws clauses
<pre {>I
Ex. Class instance creation expression:      new @Interned MyObject();
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ex. Type cast:                            |  myString = (@NonNull String) str;
------------------------------------------+---------------------------
Ex. implements clause:                    |  class UnmodifiableList<T> implements
                                          |        @Readonly List<@Readonly T> { ... }
------------------------------------------+---------------------------
Ex. thrown exception declaration:         |  void monitorTemperature() throws 
                                          |        @Critical TemperatureException { ... }
------------------------------------------+---------------------------
</pre }>I
    </li>
    <li>
Note: To make the information in @ClassPreamble appear in Javadoc-generated documentation, 
annotate the @ClassPreamble DECLARATION wih @Documented annotation like:
<pre {>
import java.lang.annotation.*;

@Documented
@interface ClassPreamble {
   ...
} 
</pre }>I
    </li>
    <li>
        predefined annotation types defined in java.lang:
        @Deprecated   @Override   @SuppressWarnings

Ex: @SuppressWarnings(value = "unchecked")
    void myMethod() { ... }
    @SuppressWarnings({"unchecked", "deprecation"})
    void myMethod() { ... }
</pre }>
    </li>
    <li>@SafeVarargs (Java ?+) when applied to a method or constructor, asserts that the code does not perform potentially 
    unsafe operations on its varargs parameter. Unchecked warnings relating to varargs usage are suppressed.

  META-ANNOTATIONS
  <ul xxxsmall zoom >
  <li>Annotations that apply to other annotations.<br/>
    There are several meta-annotation types defined in java.lang.annotation.<br/>
    @Retention: specifies how the marked annotation is stored:
<pre { >
RetentionPolicy.SOURCE: annotation is retained only in source level and is ignored by the compiler.
RetentionPolicy.CLASS: annotation is retained by compiler, but ignored by the (JVM)
RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME: annotation is retained by the JVM, can be used@RunTime 
</pre }>
    @Documented: indicates that whenever the specified annotation is used those
    elements should be documented using the Javadoc tool. (By default, annotations
    are not included in Javadoc.)<br/>
    @Target meta-annotation marks another annotation to restrict what kind of 
    Java elements the annotation can be applied to.
<pre { >
ElementType.ANNOTATION_TYPE can be applied to an annotation type.
ElementType.CONSTRUCTOR can be applied to a constructor.
ElementType.FIELD can be applied to a field or property.
ElementType.LOCAL_VARIABLE can be applied to a local variable.
ElementType.METHOD can be applied to a method-level annotation.
ElementType.PACKAGE can be applied to a package declaration.
ElementType.PARAMETER can be applied to the parameters of a method.
ElementType.TYPE can be applied to any element of a class.
</pre }>
   @Inherited meta-annotation indicates that the annotation type can be inherited
   from the super class. (This is not true by default.) When the user queries 
   the annotation type and the class has no annotation for this type, the class'
   superclass is queried for the annotation type. This annotation applies only 
   to class declarations.<br/>
   @Repeatable annotation (Java 8+), indicates that the marked annotation can be applied more than once to the same declaration or type use.

  Selectors
  <ul xxxsmall zoom>
  <li>A Selector can examine one+ Channels and determine which ones are ready for
       connect,accept,read,write</li>
  <li>This way a single thread can manage multiple channels, and thus multiple network connections</li>
  <li>Creating Selector and asigning channels:
<pre>
Selector <b orange>selector</b> = Selector.open();

// channel must be in non-blocking mode.

channel.configureBlocking(false);
<b>SelectionKey key</b> = channel.register(
            <b orange>selector</b>,
            SelectionKey.OP_READ | SelectionKey.OP_WRITE /* event "interest set" */);
/* Event can be one of:
 *    SelectionKey.OP_CONNECT   SelectionKey.OP_ACCEPT   SelectionKey.OP_READ   SelectionKey.OP_WRITE */
</pre>

</li>
  <li>FileChannel can NOT be switched into non-blocking mode and so they can NOT be used with
    selectors.</li>
  <li>A channel that "fires an event" is also said to be "ready" for that event.</li>
  <li>The SelectionKey object contains a few interesting properties appart of the associated Channel and Selector:
    <ul>
    <li>The interest set: You can read and write that interest set via the SelectionKey like this:
<pre>
int <b orange>interestSet</b> = selectionKey<b>.interestOps()</b>;
boolean isInterestedInAccept  = <b orange>interestSet</b> &amp; SelectionKey.OP_ACCEPT;
boolean isInterestedInConnect = <b orange>interestSet</b> &amp; SelectionKey.OP_CONNECT;
boolean isInterestedInRead    = <b orange>interestSet</b> &amp; SelectionKey.OP_READ;
boolean isInterestedInWrite   = <b orange>interestSet</b> &amp; SelectionKey.OP_WRITE;    
</pre>
    </li>
    <li>The ready set of operations the channel is ready for, used after a selection, explained later:
<pre>
// Alt 1:
int readySet = selectionKey.readyOps();
boolean isAcceptable  = readySet &amp; SelectionKey.OP_ACCEPT;
boolean isConnectable = readySet &amp; SelectionKey.OP_CONNECT;
boolean isReadable    = readySet &amp; SelectionKey.OP_READ;
boolean isWritable    = readySet &amp; SelectionKey.OP_WRITE;
// Alt 2:
selectionKey.isAcceptable(); selectionKey.isConnectable(); selectionKey.isReadable()  ; selectionKey.isWritable();
</pre>
    </li>
    <li>An (optional) user attached object, handy way to recognize a given channel,
      or attaching extra information like the buffer/s used with the channel...
<pre>
selectionKey.attach(theObject);
Object attachedObj = selectionKey.attachment();
// attach an object at channel registration:
SelectionKey key = channel.register(selector, SelectionKey.OP_READ, theObject);
</pre>
    </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  </ul>

  Using selectors
  <ul xxxsmall zoom>
  <li>After registering  one+ channels with a selector you can call one of the select() methods
    returnin the channels "ready" for the events you are interested in (connect, accept, read or write).
<pre>
int select()                  // blocks until at least one channel is ready for the events you registered for
int select(long milliseconds) // select() blocking for max of milliseconds timeout 
int selectNow()               // doesn't block, returning any channels ready (if any).
^ The returned int indicates how many channels became ready since last time select() was called.
</pre>
  <li>Once select() indicates that one+ channels are ready, examine selected keys like:
<pre>
Set<SelectionKey> selectedKeys = selector.<b orange>selectedKeys()</b>;
Iterator<SelectionKey> keyIterator = selectedKeys.iterator();
while(keyIterator.hasNext()) {
    SelectionKey key = keyIterator.next();
    if(false) {
    } else if (key<b>.isAcceptable ()</b>) { ...// connection was accepted by ServerSocketChannel
    } else if (key<b>.isConnectable()</b>) { ...// connection was established with a remote server
    } else if (key<b>.isReadable   ()</b>) { ...// channel is ready for reading
    } else if (key<b>.isWritable   ()</b>) { ...// channel is ready for writing
    }
    keyIterator.remove();
}
</pre>
  </li>
  <li>The channel returned by the SelectionKey.channel() method should be cast to
      the proper channel (ServerSocketChannel, SocketChannel, ...)
  </li>
  <li>A thread blocked by a call to select() can be forced to leave the select() method,
    even if no channels are yet ready by having a different thread call the <code>Selector.<b>wakeup()</b></code>
    method on the Selector which the first thread has called select() on.
    The thread waiting inside select() will then return immediately.<br/>
    If a different thread calls wakeup() and no thread is currently blocked inside select(), 
    the next thread that calls select() will "wake up" immediately.
  </li>
  <li>Selector.close(): must be called after finishing ussage, invalidating all SelectionKey
      instances registered with this Selector. The channels themselves are not closed.

  <li>A Java NIO FileChannel is a channel that is connected to a file allowing to

  </li>A FileChannel cannot be set into non-blocking mode. It always runs in blocking mode<li>
  <li>Reading from FileChannel (Writting to buffer):
<pre>
/* You cannot open a FileChannel directly,

RandomAccessFile aFile     = new RandomAccessFile("data/nio-data.txt", "rw");

  <li>Writing to a FileChannel (reading from buffer)
<pre>
String newData = "......" + System.currentTimeMillis();
ByteBuffer buf = ByteBuffer.allocate(48);
buf.clear();
buf.put(newData.getBytes());
buf.flip(); // change buffer from write to read
<b>while(buf.hasRemaining()) {</b> channel<b orange>.write</b>(buf); <b>}</b>

</pre>
  </li>
  <li>FileChannel Position
<pre>
long pos = fileChannel.position(); // obtain current position
fileChannel.position(pos +123); // change position

- If you set the position after the end of the file, and try to read from the channel, you will get -1
- If you set the position after the end of the file, and write to the channel, the file will be expanded 
  to fit the position and written data. This may result in a "file hole", where the physical file on 
  the disk has gaps in the written data.
</pre>

  <span xsmall>NonBlocking Server</span> <a xsmall href="http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java-nio/non-blocking-server.html">REF</a>
<a xsmall href="https://github.com/jjenkov/java-nio-server">GitHub</a>
  <ul xxxsmall zoom>
  <li>The ideas described in this tutorial are designed around Java NIO. However, I believe that the ideas can be reused in other languages as long as they have some kind of Selector-like construct.  As far as I know, such constructs are provided by the underlying OS, so there is a good chance that you can get access to this in other languages too.</li>
  <li>Non-blocking IO Pipelines:
<pre>
read-write pipeline: <b>channelIn</b> → selector → component → ... → componentN → <b>channelOut</b>
read-only  pipeline: <b>channelIn</b> → selector → component → ... → componentN
write-only pipeline:                        component → ... → componentN → <b>channelOut</b>
Note: It is the component that initiates reading of data from the Channel via the Selector
read-pipeline read from stream/channelIn and split data into messages like:

Data   → Message → Message
Stream   Reader    Stream
</pre>

  <li>A blocking Message Reader/Writer is simpler, sin it has never to handle situations where no data was read from the stream,
      or where only a partial message was read from the stream and message parsing needs to be resumed later.</li>
  <li>The drawback of blocking is the requirement of separate threads for each parallel stream, which is a problem if the
       server has thousands of concurrent connections</li>
  <li>Each thread will take between 320K (32 bit JVM) and 1024K (64 bit JVM) memory for its stack</li>
  <li>Queue messages can be used to reduce the problem. However, this design requires that the inbound client  streams           
     send data reasonably often and input is processed fast. If the inbound client stream may be inactive for longer periods
     attached to hidden clients, a high number of inactive connections may actually block all the threads in the thread pool.
     That means that the server becomes slow to respond or even unresponsive.  </li>
  <li>A non-blocking IO pipeline can use a single thread to read messages from multiple non-blocking streams. 
    When in non-blocking mode, a stream may return 0 or more bytes when you attempt to read data from it.
    When you call select() or selectNow() on the Selector it gives you only the SelectableChannel instances ("connected clients")
    that actually has data to read. 
<pre>
Component ──→ STEP 1: select() ──→ Selector ←──┬─→ Channel1
    ↑                                │         ┼─→ Channel2
    └───← STEP 2: ready channels ←───┘         └─→ Channel3
</pre>
  </li>
  <li>Reading Partial Messages: Data sent by "ready" channels can contain fractions/incomplete messages:
    The Message Reader looks needs to check if the data block contains at least one full message, adn storing partial ones.
    (maybe using one Message Reader per Channel to avoid mixing messages)
  </li>
  <li>To store Partial Messages two design should be considered:
    <ol>
    <li>copy data as little as possible for better performance</li>
    <li>We want full messages to be stored in consecutive byte to make parsing messages easier</li>
  </li>
  <li>Some protocol message formats are encoded using a TLV format (Type, Length, Value).  
     Memory management is much easier since we known immediately how much memory to allocate 
     for the message. No memory is wasted at the end of a buffer that is only partially used.
  </li>
  <li>The fact that TLV encodings makes memory management easier is one of the reasons why HTTP 1.1 
    is such a terrible protocol. That is one of the problems trying to be fixed in HTTP 2.0 where
    data is transported in LTV encoded frames.</li>
  <li>Writing Partial Messages: channelOut.write(ByteBuffer) in non-blocking mode gives no guarantee
     about how many of the bytes in the ByteBuffer is being written. The method returns how many bytes
     were written, so it is possible to keep track of the number of written bytes.<br/>
     Just like with the Message Reader, a Message Writer is used per channel to handle all the details. 
     (partial writes, message queues, resizable buffers, protocol aware tricks,...)
</li>
  <li>All in all a non-blocking server ends up with three "pipelines" it needs to execute regularly:
    <ol>
    <li>The read pipeline which checks for new incoming data from the open connections.</li>
    <li>The process pipeline which processes any full messages received.</li>
    <li>The write pipeline which checks if it can write any outgoing messages to any of the open connections</li>
    </ol>

Here is a diagram illustrating the full server loop:

  Concurrency Basics
  <ul xxxsmall zoom>
  <li>Concurrency problems arise from the desire to use CPU resources more efficiently. Non concurrent
    applications (single threaded/single process) are complete Touring machines that can potentially 
    solve any problem with enough time and memory. In practice having a CPU assigned to single thread
    will be very inneficient since the CPU will stand-by while the thread is waiting for input/output
    operations. Also, many algorithms allows to split processed data in isolated regions that can be
    processed in parallel by different CPU/CPU cores</li>
  <li>Concurrent tries to solve the problem of multiple independents CPUs or threads accesing share
    resources (memory)</li>
  <li>Locks is the simples concurrent primite to protect code or data from concurrent
    access in situations where there are many threads of execution. Locks can be classified like:
<pre>
According to lock ussage:
   Cooperative   A thread is encouraged (but not forced) to cooperate with other
                 threads by adquiring a lock before accessing the associated data
                 
   Mandatory     a thread trying to access an already locked resource will throw
                 an exception
_________________________________________________
According to lock rescheduing strategy:
   Blocking      The OS block the thread requesting the lock and rescheduled another thread

   Spinlock      The thread waits in a loop until the requested lock becomes available. 
                 It's more efficient if threads are blocked for very short time (smaller than
                 the time needed by the OS to reschedule another thread into the current CPU)
                 It's inneficient if the lock is held for a long time since a CPU core is
                 waisted on the spinlock loop
_________________________________________________
According to granularity: (measure of the ammount of data the lock is protecting)
   Coarse        Protect large segments of data (few locks). Results in less lock overhead
                 for a single thread, but worse performance for many threads running concurrently
                 (most thread will be lock-contended waiting for share resource access)

   Fine          Protrect small amounts of data. Require more lock instances reducing lock
                 contention
</pre>
  </li>
  <li>Locks require CPU atomic instructions for efficient implementations suchs as 
      "test-and-set", "fetch-and-add", or "compare-and-swap", whether there are blocking
      (managed by the OS) or spinlocks (managed by the thread)</li>
  <li>Uniprocessors can just disable interruptions to implement locks, while multiprocessors
    using shared-memory will require complex hardware and/or software support</li>
  <li><b>Monitors wrap mutex-locks with condition variables (container of threads waiting
     for certain condition)</b>. They are implemented as thread-safe classes </li>
  </ul>
</td>
<td>
  Java monitors
  <ul xxxsmall zoom { >
  <li>The simplest form of synchronization in Java is the mutual exclusion of
    threads to shared resources using monitors</li>
  <li>Monitors also have the ability to wait(block a thread) for a certain condition
    to become true, and signal other threads that their condition has been met</li>
  <li><b>Monitors provide a mechanism for threads to temporarily give up exclusive access in
    order to wait for some condition to be met, before regaining exclusive access and
    resuming their task</b></li>
  <li>each java object can be used as a monitor.</li>
  <li>Methods/blocks of code requiring mutual exclusion must be explicitly marked with the
    <code orange>synchronized keyword</code></li>
  <li>Instead of explicit condition variables, each monitor(/object) is equipped with
    a single wait queue in addition to its entrance queue.</li>
  <li>All waiting is done on this single wait queue and all <code orange>notify/notifyAll</code>
    operations apply to this queue.

  Summary
  <ul xxxsmall zoom >
  <li>addition of lambda expressions in Java 8 created opportunities for functional APIs in Java. This is a boon for non-blocking applications and continuation style APIs — as popularized by CompletableFuture and ReactiveX, that allow declarative composition of asynchronous logic. At the programming model level Java 8 enabled Spring WebFlux to offer functional web endpoints alongside with annotated controllers.
  </li>
  <li>The term "reactive" refers to programming models that are built around reacting to change — network component reacting to I/O events, UI controller reacting to mouse events, etc. In that sense non-blocking is reactive because instead of being blocked we are now in the mode of reacting to notifications as operations complete or data becomes available.
  </li>
  <li>Spring Reactive Streams is a small spec, also adopted in Java 9, that defines the interaction between asynchronous components with back pressure. For example a data repository — acting as Publisher, can produce data that an HTTP server — acting as Subscriber, can then write to the response. The main purpose of Reactive Streams is to allow the subscriber to control how fast or how slow the publisher will produce data.
  </li>
  <li>Reactive Streams plays an important role for interoperability. It is of interest to libraries and infrastructure components but less useful as an application API because it is too low level. What applications need is a higher level and richer, functional API to compose async logic — similar to the Java 8 Stream API but not only for collections. This is the role that reactive libraries play.

    <li>
Public review of JSR 374: Java API for JSON Processing (JSON-P) version 1.1 is now open. 
This version is expected to be included in the release of J2EE 8 and keeps JSON-P current with JSON IETF standards. It includes support for:
      <ul>
      <li>JSON Pointer</li>
      <li>JSON Patch</li>
      <li>JSON Merge Patch</li>
      <li>Query and transformation operations</li>
      <li>Java 8 streams and lambdas</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>JSON-P was introduced in 2013 with the release of J2EE 7, as an alternative to Gson and Jackson. It was designed to parse, generate, 
and query standard JSON documents.

JSR-367: Java API for JSON Binding (JSON-B), will also be included in the release of J2EE 8.

  [QA] Checker framework
  <ul xxxsmall zoom {>
  <li>
    <a href='https://blogs.oracle.com/java-platform-group/entry/java_8_s_new_type'>REF: Oracle Java 8 new Type Annotations</a>
Java SE 8 allows type annotations anywhere that a type is used. Previously, 
annotations were only allowed on definitions. 
The Checker Framework provides a few Type Annotations that could benefit both 
library and application developers, such as:
<pre {>
@NonNull: compiler can determine cases where a code path might receive a null.

@ReadOnly: compiler will flag any attempt to change the object.

@Regex – compile-time verification that a String intended to be used 
    as a regular expression is a properly formatted regular expression.

@Tainted and @Untainted: Identity types of data that should not be used
    together, such as remote user input being used in system commands, 
    or sensitive information in log streams.

@m – Units of measure ensures that numbers used for measuring objects 
    are used and compared correctly, or have undergone the proper unit
    conversion.
</pre }>
  </li>
  <li TODO >installation process:<br/>
    Download the Checker Framework distribution: 
      https://checkerframework.org/checker-framework-2.1.8.zip. <br/>
    Configure your IDE, build system, or command shell to include the 
    Checker Framework on the classpath. Choose the appropriate section of 
    Chapter 30 for javac (Section 30.1), Ant (Section 30.2), Maven (Section 30.3),
    Gradle (Section 30.4), IntelliJ IDEA (Section 30.6), Eclipse (Section 30.7),
    or tIDE (Section 30.8).<br/>
    Option 1: Add directory .../checker-framework-2.1.8/checker/bin to your path, before any other directory that contains a javac executable.</li>
  <li>The Nullness Checker supports several annotations that specify method 
      behavior. <br/>
     These are declaration annotations, not type annotations:<br/>
     they apply to the method itself rather than to some particular type.<br/>
     @RequiresNonNull (precondition): annotated method expects the specified 
     variables to be non-null when the method is invoked.<br/>
       @EnsuresNonNull (postcondition): the given expressions are non-null 
     after the method returns;<br/>
       @EnsuresNonNullIf: if annotated method returns true|false, then the 
     given expressions are non-null.<br/>
  </li>
  <li>The Lock Checker prevents certain concurrency errors by enforcing a 
    locking discipline. A locking discipline indicates which locks must be 
    held when a given operation occurs. You express the locking discipline by 
    declaring a variable’s type to have the qualifier @GuardedBy("lockexpr"). 
    This indicates that the variable’s value may be dereferenced only if the 
    given lock is held.</li>
  <li>@GuardedBy(exprSet): If a variable x has type @GuardedBy("expr"), then a thread may dereference the value referred to by x only when the thread holds the lock that expr currently evaluates to. It can list multiple expressions, as in @GuardedBy({"expr1", "expr2"}), in which case the dereference is permitted only if the thread holds all the locks.</li>
  <li>Method pre-conditions and post-conditions<br/>
@Holding(String[] locks): All the given lock expressions are held at the method call site.<br/>
@EnsuresLockHeld(String[] locks): The given lock expressions are locked upon method return if the method terminates successfully. This is useful for annotating a method that acquires a lock such as ReentrantLock.lock().<br/>
@EnsuresLockHeldIf(String[] locks, boolean result): If the annotated method returns the given boolean value (true or false), the given lock expressions are locked upon method return if the method terminates successfully. This is useful for annotating a method that conditionally acquires a lock. See Section 6.4.4 for examples.</li>
  <li>Side effect specifications<br/>
@LockingFree: The method does not acquire or release locks, directly or indirectly. The method is not synchronized, it contains no synchronized blocks, it contains no calls to lock or unlock methods, and it contains no calls to methods that are not themselves @LockingFree. <br/>
    Since @SideEffectFree implies @LockingFree, if both are applicable then you only need to write @SideEffectFree.<br/>
@ReleasesNoLocks: The method maintains a strictly nondecreasing lock hold count on the current thread for any locks that were held prior to the method call. The method might acquire locks but then release them, or might acquire locks but not release them (in which case it should also be annotated with @EnsuresLockHeld or @EnsuresLockHeldIf).<br/>
    This is the default for methods being type-checked that have no @LockingFree, @MayReleaseLocks, @SideEffectFree, or @Pure annotation.<br/>
  </li>
  <li>The Format String Checker prevents use of incorrect format strings in format methods such as System.out.printf and String.format. Ej:
<pre>
void printFloatAndInt(@Format({FLOAT, INT}) String fs) {
        System.out.printf(fs, 3.1415, 42);
    }
</pre>
  </li>
  <li>Here are the examples of errors that the I18n Format Checker detects at compile time
<pre {>
// Warning: the second argument is missing.
MessageFormat.format("{0} {1}", 3.1415);
// String argument cannot be formatted as Time type.
MessageFormat.format("{0, time}", "my string");
// Invalid format string: unknown format type: thyme.
MessageFormat.format("{0, thyme}", new Date());
// Invalid format string: missing the right brace.
MessageFormat.format("{0", new Date());
// Invalid format string: the argument index is not an integer.
MessageFormat.format("{0.2, time}", new Date());
// Invalid format string: "#.#.#" subformat is invalid.
MessageFormat.format("{0, number, #.#.#}", 3.1415);
</pre } >
  </li>
  <li>The Property File Checker ensures that a property file or resource bundle (both of which act like maps from keys to values) is only accessed with valid keys. Accesses without a valid key either return null or a default value, which can lead to a NullPointerException or hard-to-trace behavior. The Property File Checker (Section 12.1) ensures that the used keys are found in the corresponding property file or resource bundle.</li>
  <li>One of the most prevalent GUI-related bugs is invalid UI update or invalid thread access: accessing the UI directly from a background thread.

Most GUI frameworks (including Android, AWT, Swing, and SWT) create a single distinguished thread — the UI event thread — that handles all GUI events and updates. To keep the interface responsive, any expensive computation should be offloaded to background threads (also called worker threads). If a background thread accesses a UI element such as a JPanel (by calling a JPanel method or reading/writing a field of JPanel), the GUI framework raises an exception that terminates the program. To fix the bug, the background thread should send a request to the UI thread to perform the access on its behalf.

It is difficult for a programmer to remember which methods may be called on which thread(s). The GUI Effect Checker solves this problem. The programmer annotates each method to indicate whether:

    It accesses no UI elements (and may run on any thread); such a method is said to have the “safe effect”.
    It may access UI elements (and must run on the UI thread); such a method is said to have the “UI effect”. 
  </li>
  <li>The following kind of (physical) UNIT annotations are defined:
<pre { >
@Acceleration @Angle @Area @Current @Length @Luminance @Mass
@Speed @Substance @Temperature @Time

For each kind of unit, the corresponding SI unit of measurement is defined:

For @Acceleration: Meter Per Second Square @mPERs2
For @Angle: Radians @radians, and the derived unit Degrees @degrees
For @Area: the derived units square millimeters @mm2, square meters @m2, and square kilometers @km2
For @Current: Ampere @A
For @Length: Meters @m and the derived units millimeters @mm and kilometers @km
For @Luminance: Candela @cd
For @Mass: kilograms @kg and the derived unit grams @g
For @Speed: meters per second @mPERs and kilometers per hour @kmPERh
For @Substance: Mole @mol
For @Temperature: Kelvin @K and the derived unit Celsius @C
For @Time: seconds @s and the derived units minutes @min and hours @h 
</pre }>
  </li>
  <li>The Signedness Checker guarantees that signed and unsigned values are not mixed together in a computation. In addition, it prohibits meaningless operations, such as division on an unsigned value.
@Unsigned  @Signed
  </li>
  <li>A type alias or typedef is a type that shares the same representation as another type but is conceptually distinct from it. For example, some strings in your program may be street addresses; others may be passwords; and so on. You wish to indicate, for each string, which one it is, and to avoid mixing up the different types of strings. Likewise, you could distinguish integers that are offsets from those that are absolute values.</li>
  <li>SPARTA is a security toolset aimed at preventing malware from appearing in an app store. SPARTA provides an information-flow type-checker that is customized to Android but can also be applied to other domains. The SPARTA toolset is available from https://checkerframework.org/sparta/. The paper “Collaborative verification of information flow for a high-assurance app store” appeared in CCS 2014.</li>
  <li>Example:
<pre { >
@NonNull List&lt;String>

List&lt;@NonNull String> 

@Regex String validation = "(Java|JDK) [7,8]"

private String getInput(String parameterName){
 final String retval = @Tainted request.getParameter(parameterName);
 return retval;
} 

private void runCommand(@Untainted String… commands){
 // the previously tainted String must be validated before being passed in here.
 ProcessBuilder processBuilder = new ProcessBuilder(command);
 Process process = processBuilder.start();

""" Although Spring provides many benefits, it was created in a pre-Java-5 world. The Guice framework takes DI to the next level, leveraging the full power of Java typing, especially annotations and generics"""
-------------------------------------------------
{
Java programming language provides multiple mechanisms for communicating between threads:
- The most basic of these methods is synchronization, which is implemented using monitors.
  Each object in Java is associated with a monitor, which a thread can lock or unlock.
 Only one thread at a time may hold a lock on a monitor. Any other threads attempting to
 lock that monitor are blocked until they can obtain a lock on that monitor. A thread t
 may lock a particular monitor multiple times; each unlock reverses the effect of one
 lock operation.
The synchronized statement (§14.19) computes a reference to an object; it then attempts to perform a lock action on that object's monitor and does not proceed further until the lock action has successfully completed. After the lock action has been performed, the body of the synchronized statement is executed. If execution of the body is ever completed, either normally or abruptly, an unlock action is automatically performed on that same monitor.

 A synchronized method (§8.4.3.6) automatically performs a lock action when it is invoked; its body is not executed until the lock action has successfully completed. If the method is an instance method, it locks the monitor associated with the instance for which it was invoked (that is, the object that will be known as this during execution of the body of the method). If the method is static, it locks the monitor associated with the Class object that represents the class in which the method is defined. If execution of the method's body is ever completed, either normally or abruptly, an unlock action is automatically performed on that same monitor.

 The Java programming language neither prevents nor requires detection of deadlock conditions. Programs where threads hold (directly or indirectly) locks on multiple objects should use conventional techniques for deadlock avoidance, creating higher-level locking primitives that do not deadlock, if necessary.
 Other mechanisms, such as reads and writes of volatile variables and the use of classes in the java.util.concurrent package, provide alternative ways of synchronization.
Every object, in addition to having an associated monitor, has an associated wait-set. A wait-set is a set of threads.
 When an object is first created, its wait set is empty. Elementary actions that add threads to and remove threads from wait sets are atomic. Wait sets are manipulated solely through the methods Object.wait, Object.notify, and Object.notifyAll.

Let thread t be the thread executing the wait method on object m, and let n be the number of lock actions by t on m that have not been matched by unlock actions.
  - A notify action being performed on m in which t is selected for removal from the wait set.
  - A notifyAll action being performed on m. 
  - An interrupt action being performed on t. 
  - If this is a timed wait, an internal action removing t from m's wait set that occurs after at least millisecs milliseconds plus nanosecs nanoseconds elapse since the beginning of this wait action. 
  - An internal action by the implementation. Implementations are permitted, although not encouraged, to perform "spurious wake-ups",
    that is, to remove threads from wait sets and thus enable resumption without explicit instructions to do so.
  
 Notification actions occur upon invocation of methods notify and notifyAll.

Memory that can be shared between threads is called shared memory or heap memory. All instance fields, static fields, and array elements are stored in heap memory. In this chapter, we use the term variable to refer to both fields and array elements. Local variables (Â§14.4), formal method parameters (Â§8.4.1), and exception handler parameters (Â§14.20) are never shared between threads and are unaffected by the memory model.

REF: http://www.baeldung.com/java-completablefuture
  |In asynchronous computation, actions are represented as callbacks, handling errors might occur at any step.
  |
  |Java 5+: Future: Represent an asynchronous computation
  |Java 8+: CompletableFuture : Extends Future with methods to combine and handle errors
  |                            Extends the CompletionStage interface
  |                              - Contract for an asynchronous computation step that
  |                                can be combined with other steps.
  |                            About 50 different methods for composing, combining, executing async computation
  |
  |
  |Using CompletableFuture as a Simple Future (no-arg constructor) 
  |
  |In the example below we have a method that creates a CompletableFuture instance, then spins off some computation in another thread and returns the Future immediately.
  |
  |  1  public Future<String> calculateAsync() throws InterruptedException {
  |  2      Future<String> result = new CompletableFuture<>();
  |  3     
  |  4      Executors.newCachedThreadPool().submit(() -> {
  |  5          Thread.sleep(500);
  |  6          completableFuture.complete("Hello");
  |  7          return null;
  |  8      });
  |  9   
  |  10     return completableFuture;
  |  11 }
  |  Line 2: Alternatively when the result of computation is known:
  |          Future<String> result = CompletableFuture.
  |             completedFuture("Hello");
  |  
  |  Line 6: Alternatively completableFuture.cancel(false);
  |  Line 5: any other mechanism can be used to compute 
  |    
  |
  |  1 Future<String> completableFuture = calculateAsync();
  |  2  
  |  3 // ... 
  |  4  
  |  5 String result = completableFuture.get();
  |  6 assertEquals("Hello", result);
  |
  |Line 5: get() blocks until .complete("...") is called in other thread
  |Line 5: get()can raise 
  |           ExecutionException: error during computation
  |           InterruptedException: thread executing method interrupted
  |
  |4. CompletableFuture with Encapsulated Computation Logic (runAsync -<<Runnable>>-, supplyAsync -<<Supplier>>-)
  |
  |<<Supplier>>: generic functional interface with single method (zero arguments, returns value)
  |
  |  1 CompletableFuture<String> future
  |  2   = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(/*supplier lambda*/ () -> "Hello")
  |  3 .thenApply(/* "processor" lambda */ s -> s + " World") /* returns CompletableFuture */;
  |  4 .thenAccept(/*consumer lambda */ 
  |  5    s -> System.out.println("Computation returned: " + s));
  |    Line 4: Alternatively (ignrore result)
  |    .thenRun(/*Runnable lambda*/ () -> System.out.println("Computation finished."));
  |
  |5. Combining Futures (monadic design pattern in functional languages)
  |
  |  1 CompletableFuture<String> completableFuture 
  |  2   = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> "Hello")
  |  3     .thenCompose(
  |  4           s -> CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> s + " World"));
  |  4  
  |  5 assertEquals("Hello World", completableFuture.get());
  |    
  |6. Execute two independent Futures and do something with their results
  |
  |  1 CompletableFuture future  
  |  2   = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> "Hello")
  |  3     .thenCombine(CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(
  |  4       () -> " World"), (s1, s2) -> s1 + s2));
  |  5  
  |  6 assertEquals("Hello World", future.get());
  |    
  |(Simpler case - nothing to do with resulting value-)
  |  2   = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> "Hello")
  |  3   .thenAcceptBoth(CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(
  |  4      () -> " World"), (s1, s2) -> log(s1 + s2));
  |    
  |7. Running Multiple Futures in Parallel:  wait for all to execute and process combined results
  |
  |  1  CompletableFuture<String> future1  
  |  2    = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> "Hello");
  |  3  CompletableFuture<String> future2  
  |  4    = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> "Beautiful");
  |  5  CompletableFuture<String> future3  
  |  6    = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> "World");
  |  7   
  |  8  CompletableFuture<Void> combinedFuture 
  |  9    = CompletableFuture.allOf(future1, future2, future3);
  |  10  
  |  11 // ...
  |  12  
  |  13 combinedFuture.get();
  |  14  
  |  15 String combined = Stream.of(future1, future2, future3)
  |  16   .map(CompletableFuture::join)
  |  17   .collect(Collectors.joining(" "));
  |  18 assertEquals("Hello Beautiful World", combined);
  |
  |    Line 16: join() is similar to get, but throws unchecked exception if the Future does not complete normally.
  |
  |8. Handling Errors
  |
  |   Instead of catching an exception in a syntactic block, the CompletableFuture class allows you to handle it in a special handle method. This method receives two parameters: a result of a computation (if it finished successfully) and the exception thrown (if some computation step did not complete normally).
  |
  |
  |
  |Capture async exception:
  |           
  |  1  CompletableFuture<String> completableFuture  
  |  2    =  CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
  |  3        ... if(errorDetected) 
  |  4               throw new RuntimeException("Computation error!");
  |  6        return "Hello ";
  |  7    })}).handle((s, t) -> s != null ? s : "Hello, Stranger!");
  |  8   
  |  9  assertEquals("Hello, Stranger!", completableFuture.get());
  |Alt: 
  |  1  completableFuture.completeExceptionally(
  |  2    new RuntimeException("Calculation failed!"));
  |  3  ...  
  |  4  completableFuture.get(); // ExecutionException
  |                                                                            
  |9. Async Methods
  | - The methods without the Async postfix run next execution stage using a calling thread.
  |
  | - The Async method without the Executor argument runs a step using the common fork/join pool implementation of Executor 
  |   that is accessed with the ForkJoinPool.commonPool() method.
  |
  | - The Async method with an Executor argument runs a step using the passed Executor.
  |
  | Ex.: process result of computation with a Function instance
  |  1 CompletableFuture<String> completableFuture  
  |  2   = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> "Hello");
  |  3  
  |  4 CompletableFuture<String> future = completableFuture
  |  5   .thenApplyAsync(s -> s + " World");
  |  6  
  |  7 assertEquals("Hello World", future.get());
  |
  |    Line 5: under the hood the application of a function is wrapped into a ForkJoinTask instance 
  |    (for more information on the fork/join framework, see the article ?Guide to the Fork/Join Framework in Java?).
  |    This allows to parallelize your computation even more and use system resources more efficiently.

Non-Blocking I/O Made Possible in Java  http://www.developer.com/java/article.php/3837316/Non-Blocking-IO-Made-Possible-in-Java.htm
In this article we will review non-blocking IO, a feature of java.nio (New I/O) package that is a part of Java v1.4, v1.5 and v1.6 and introduce the java.nio.file (NIO.2) package. NIO.2 will be included in the upcoming Java SE7 ("Dolphin") release.

The Selector for Single-Thread Multi-Socket I/O

A Selector allows processing of multiple sockets I/O read & write operations in a single thread, also known as multiplexing, solving the
limitation of 'one dedicated thread per socket connection.' It manages SelectableChannels (gateway for registering/deregistering channels), 
SelectionKeys (glue that associates Selectors, Channels and their I/O events) and monitors concurrent thread executions involved in network operations.

Spring Reactor:

  https://ordina-jworks.github.io/reactive/2016/12/12/Reactive-Programming-Spring-Reactor.html

  """Why Reactor when there's already RxJava2?

   RxJava2 is java 6 while for Reactor the Spring team decided to go all in and focus only on Java 8. This means that you can make use of all the new and fancy Java 8 features.

If you are going to use Spring 5, Reactor might be the better option.

But if you are happy with your RxJava2, there is no direct need to migrate to Reactor."""

Apache MINA vs Netty: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2pWsxPWJuc

Apache MINA is a network application framework which helps users develop high performance and high scalability network applications easily. It provides an abstract event-driven asynchronous API over various transports such as TCP/IP and UDP/IP via Java NIO.

Apache MINA is often called:

    NIO framework library,
    client server framework library, or
    a networking socket library

Apache MINA comes with many subprojects :

    Asyncweb : An HTTP server build on top of MINA asynchronous framework
    FtpServer : A FTP server
    SSHd : A Java library supporting the SSH protocol
    Vysper : An XMPP server

Project Loom:
Project Loom's mission is to make it easier to write, debug, profile and maintain concurrent applications meeting today's requirements. Threads, provided by Java from its first day, are a natural and convenient concurrency construct (putting aside the separate question of communication among threads) which is being supplanted by less convenient abstractions because their current implementation as OS kernel threads is insufficient for meeting modern demands, and wasteful in computing resources that are particularly valuable in the cloud. Project Loom will introduce fibers as lightweight, efficient threads managed by the Java Virtual Machine, that let developers use the same simple abstraction but with better performance and lower footprint. We want to make concurrency simple(r) again! A fiber is made of two components — a continuation and a scheduler. As Java already has an excellent scheduler in the form of ForkJoinPool, fibers will be implemented by adding continuations to the JVM.

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39688830/why-use-develop-guice-when-you-have-spring-and-dagger
 
Q: Why use/develop Guice, when You have Spring and Dagger? [closed]
  To my knowledge, Dagger does generate code, while Guice and Spring rely on 
runtime processing, thus Dagger works faster, but requires more work on 
programmer side. Because of performance edge it's good for mobile (Android)
 development.

However, when we are left with Guice and Spring, the latter has lots of 
integrations. What's the point of developing/using Guice, if we can use
Spring Framework (that does basically same thing, but offers ex. easier 
database access)?

Isn't Google trying to reinvent wheel by creating their own DI tool,
instead of using (and possibly contributing to) Spring Framework?

I am looking for decision tree, that guides through choosing DI tool.

A: t's important to realize that Dagger was created after Guice, by one 
of Guice's creators ("Crazy Bob" Lee) after his move to Square:
  - Spring was originally released in October 2002.
  - Google originally publicly released Guice in March 2007.
  - JSR-330 formalized javax.inject annotations in October 2009, 
    with heavy input from Google (Bob Lee), Spring, and other industry 
    players.
  - Square originally released Dagger 1 publicly in May 2013.
  - Google originally released Dagger 2 publicly in April 2015.
  - Square marked Dagger 1 as deprecated 10 days ago, 
    on September 15, 2016.

In that sense, the continued curation of Guice isn't "reinventing the 
  wheel" so much as maintenance on a long-running and widely-consumed
 software package that thoroughly predates any version of Dagger. To 
list and amend to the differences you have above:

    Spring is a relatively-heavyweight framework with a lot of
 integrations, an XML configuration language, and runtime/reflective 
bindings. Applications already using Spring can use Spring's dependency
 injection framework with very little extra work.
    Guice is a relatively-lightweight framework with fewer integrations,
 Java instance configuration, and runtime/reflective bindings. With the
 use of Java bindings, you get compile-time type checking and IDE
 autocomplete integration.
    Dagger is a very lightweight framework with very few integrations,
 Java interface/annotation configuration, and compile-time code-generated
 bindings. The code generation aspect makes Dagger very performant 
overall and particularly in resource-limited and mobile environments.
(Android's different VM makes reflection especially slow, so Dagger is
especially useful here.)
    All three of the above frameworks support JSR-330 (Dependency
Injection for Java) , so a well-crafted library or application can
 be mostly agnostic to the DI container used.  
JSR-330:

Beyond that, keep an eye out for maintenance/deprecation patterns and policies among any framework you use, but leave it up to the integrations and performance you need alongside your team's technical judgment.
