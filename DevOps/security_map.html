Threats to users’ privacy and security are growing. At Mozilla, we closely track these threats. We believe we have a duty to do everything we can to protect Firefox users and their data.

We’re taking on the companies and organizations that want to secretly collect and sell user data. This is why we added tracking protection and created the Facebook container extension. And you’ll be seeing us do more things to protect our users over the coming months.

    Evaluate the system

Tools

The OpenSCAP ecosystem provides multiple tools to assist administrators and auditors with assessment, measurement and enforcement of security baselines. We maintain great flexibility and interoperability, reducing costs of performing security audits.

Security Policies
The OpenSCAP project provides a wide variety of hardening guides and configuration baselines developed by the open source community, ensuring that you can choose a security policy which best suits the needs of your organization, regardless of its size.

Standards
Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) is U.S. standard maintained by National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The OpenSCAP project is a collection of open source tools for implementing and enforcing this standard, and has been awarded the SCAP 1.2 certification by NIST in 2014.

Helping to protect IT environments from cyber attacks and comply with tightening compliance standards, SIEM systems are becoming the cornerstone for security paradigms implemented by a growing number of organizations.

In a previous post, we explained what a SIEM system actually is — why organizations require it to start with, the components it is comprised of, and how it helps mitigate attacks. One of the conclusions reached in that article was that SIEM is not actually a single tool in itself, but is instead comprised of multiple monitoring and analysis components.

There are proprietary platforms that do offer an all-in-one SIEM solution, such as LogRhythm, QRadar, and ArcSight. These solutions can become rather expensive, especially in the long run and in larger organizations, and so more and more companies are on the search for an open source SIEM platform.

But is there an open source platform that includes all the basic SIEM ingredients?

The simple answer is — no. There is no all-in-one perfect open source SIEM system. Existing solutions either lack core SIEM capabilities, such as event correlation and reporting or require combining with other tools. As always, though, there are some good contenders, and in this article, we take a look at six of these platforms.

SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) is a security and auditing system comprised of different monitoring and analysis components. The recent rise in cyber attacks, together with tighter security regulations required from organizations, are making SIEM a standard security approach which is being adopted by an increasing amount of organizations.

Scientists Extract RSA Key From GnuPG Using Sound of CPU 264
Posted by Soulskill on Wednesday December 18, 2013 @06:05PM from the noisy-fans-are-now-a-feature dept.
kthreadd writes
"In their research paper titled RSA Key Extraction via Low-Bandwidth Acoustic Cryptanalysis, Daniel Genkin, Adi Shamir and Eran Tromer et al. present a method for extracting decryption keys from the GnuPG security suite using an interesting side-channel attack. By analysing the acoustic sound made by the CPU they were able to extract a 4096-bit RSA key in about an hour (PDF). A modern mobile phone placed next to the computer is sufficient to carry out the attack, but up to four meters have been successfully tested using specially designed microphones."

YARA in a nutshell                                                              rule silent_banker : banker
                                                                                {
YARA is a tool aimed at (but not limited to) helping malware researchers to         meta:
identify and classify malware samples. With YARA you can create descriptions            description = "This is just an example"
of malware families (or whatever you want to describe) based on textual or              thread_level = 3
binary patterns. Each description, a.k.a rule, consists of a set of strings             in_the_wild = true
and a boolean expression which determine its logic. Let's see an example:       
                                                                                    strings:
                                                                                        $a = {6A 40 68 00 30 00 00 6A 14 8D 91}
                                                                                        $b = {8D 4D B0 2B C1 83 C0 27 99 6A 4E 59 F7 F9}
                                                                                        $c = "UVODFRYSIHLNWPEJXQZAKCBGMT"
                                                                                
                                                                                    condition:
                                                                                        $a or $b or $c
                                                                                }

The above rule is telling YARA that any file containing one of the three 
strings must be reported as silent_banker. This is just a simple example, 
more complex and powerful rules can be created by using wild-cards, case-
insensitive strings, regular expressions, special operators and many other 
features that you'll find explained in YARA's documentation.

multi-platform, running on Windows, Linux and Mac OS X, and can be 
used through its command-line interface or from your own Python scripts with 
the yara-python extension.

SAP has released the source code for Vulnerability Assessment Tool, a software composition analysis (SCA) tool that was tested internally for two years with 20,000 scans on more than 600 projects.

The Vulnerability Assessment Tool focuses specifically on the detection of vulnerable components as it is stated in OWASP-Top 10 2017 A9. The tool scans software packages for direct and transitive dependencies and then compares each dependency to known sources, like the National Vulnerability Database or CVE list, to determine if known vulnerabilities or exploits exist for each package. During development, this knowledge can inform developers on when they should upgrade certain components. During operations, when a new vulnerability is discovered, this information can be used to locate which applications require action.

The OWASP Top 10 is a powerful awareness document for web application security. It represents a broad consensus about the most critical security risks to web applications. Project members include a variety of security experts from around the world who have shared their expertise to produce this list.

We urge all companies to adopt this awareness document within their organization and start the process of ensuring that their web applications minimize these risks. Adopting the OWASP Top 10 is perhaps the most effective first step towards changing the software development culture within your organization into one that produces secure code.
