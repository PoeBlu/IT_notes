System Administration

System administration of a WebLogic Server environment includes tasks such as creating WebLogic Server domains; deploying applications; migrating domains from development environments to production environments; monitoring and configuring the performance of the WebLogic Server domain; and diagnosing and troubleshooting problems.

 

 WebLogic Server provides many tools for system administrators to help with these tasks, including a browser-based Administration Console, the WebLogic Scripting Tool (WLST), a scripting language for automation of WebLogic system administration tasks based on Jython, SNMP, the Configuration Wizard, and command-line utilities. See Choosing the Appropriate Technology for Your Administrative Tasks and Summary of System Administration Tools and APIs.

 

 

The Administration Console is a Web browser-based, graphical user interface that you use to manage a WebLogic Server domain. A WebLogic Server domain is a logically related group of WebLogic Server resources that you manage as a unit. A domain includes one or more WebLogic Servers and may also include WebLogic Server clusters. Clusters are groups of WebLogic Servers instances that work together to provide scalability and high-availability for applications. You deploy and manage your applications as part of a domain.

 

One instance of WebLogic Server in each domain is configured as an Administration Server. The Administration Server provides a central point for managing a WebLogic Server domain. All other WebLogic Server instances in a domain are called Managed Servers. In a domain with only a single WebLogic Server instance, that server functions both as Administration Server and Managed Server. The Administration Server hosts the Administration Console, which is a Web application accessible from any supported Web browser with network access to the Administration Server.

 

Use the Administration Console to:

    Configure, start, and stop WebLogic Server instances

    Configure WebLogic Server clusters

    Configure WebLogic Server services, such as database connectivity (JDBC) and messaging (JMS)

    Configure security parameters, including managing users, groups, and roles

    Configure and deploy your applications

    Monitor server and application performance

    View server and domain log files

    View application deployment descriptors

    Edit selected run-time application deployment descriptor elements

Enabling the Administration Console

By default, the Administration Console is enabled. If you disable it, you can re-enable it using the WebLogic Scripting Tool (WLST). Start the Administration Server, then invoke WLST and use the following commands:

Example 1 Using WLST to Re-enable the Console

    connect("username","password")
    edit()
    startEdit()
    cmo.setConsoleEnabled(true)
    save()
    activate()
    The following attribute(s) have been changed on MBeans which require server re-start.
    MBean Changed : com.bea:Name=mydomain,Type=Domain Attributes changed : 
    ConsoleEnabled
    Activation completed
    disconnect()
    exit()

war vs ear deployment?

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1364273/when-is-it-appropriate-to-use-an-ear-and-when-should-your-apps-be-in-wars

 

A1: The argument to package multiple WARs into an EAR can be compelling if you run into the situation that my last employer did, where you have a common set of library JARs that are used by multiple WARs, and the size of that collection of JARs is considerable. In our particular situation, the total size of 3 WARs with the common JARs packaged into each WAR totaled 124MB. By locating the JARs in the containing EAR and configuring the classpath of each WAR to use those JARs, the footprint of the EAR that contained the 3 WARs was reduced to 40MB. I'd consider that a compelling reason.
Nothing is actually wrong with just deploying wars, developers have an interest in getting tasks met quickly as possible. That means they often will take on technical debt, and if they are in a respectable team, they will clean that debt.

A2: This however presents a problem, what happens when you avoid the complexity of EARs, and share a jar by adding it to the application server? Much more common in the war only team, is offloading all sorts of application complexity to the application server. Simply because it was easier to implement, in their often over-allocated schedule. I don't blame them for this at all, However now we have a new problem. A standard application server cannot be used, you must do system side customizations. Effectively the web application is bleeding all over the system. The person who maintains the Application server, now MUST also know application specific details... in an enterprise environment, this presents a very clear problem.

The developers can then take on system responsibility, but they still need to meet deadlines. They inevitably bleed all over the OS as well, and suddenly the developers are the only possible admins. If an admin doesn?t know what the application is using system side, they can very much cause major problems. These unclear lines always end in fingers pointing in both directions, unknown system states, and team isolation.

Do they have to use an EAR then? Nope, I'm a systems Engineer, so I always say they can deploy their own application server like another commercial application. Inside an RPM, if deploying a WAR is like other supported Application Servers, then they get the WAR deployment pipeline. If not, then RPM all in one... Once not allowing the team to externalize their costs, then EARs become a GREAT idea.

WLST by Examples: Restarting 24 x 7 Domain with WLST

Here I have little bit struggle to reach a conclusion that, what all servers need to stop? when to stop? the preparing script I did with my analysis that stated that few sites requires 24x7 HA. Few of them don't need the HA, that is site can have sometime outage where it doesn't have request for the application.

Me and Prasanna Yalam discussed about a strategy where every time you run few servers can be stopped from different physical locations. when starting them up then only next round of managed servers can be stopped. This strategy implementation firstly thought with 2 scripts then I made it 2 phases one by one can be done with user input. This module named as 'regularStop()', which supports 24x7 HA domain.

One more thing we need to consider here is most of the Production deployments are in nostage mode, when new version release of application code requires complete domain down option requirement. This is another module take cares where it will stop all clusters in the domain should be passed. The module named as 'releaseStop()'. This you can use for any WebLogic domain.

After composing whole script ran it then found that there is need of server state or cluster state when it is given shutdown command. So every shutdown command is followed by state command given that gives more confidence on script how it is executing.

Finally by performing releaseStop() or RegularStop() we can go for stopping the Admin Server.

Note: Don't forget proper indentations, while editing my script it might be disturbed here.

You can run this script with java in your PATH and weblogic.jar in the CLASSPATH.
