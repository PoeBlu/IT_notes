  Terminology
<pre xxxsmall zoom>
Term                        Description
Access Vector (AV)          A bit map representing a set of permissions (such as open, read, write)

Access Vector Cache (AVC)    A   component   that   stores   access   decisions   made   by   the
                            SELinux  Security   Server for   subsequent   use   by  Object Managers.
                            This  allows   previous   decisions   to be  retrieved
                            without the overhead of re-computation.
                            Within the core SELinux services there are two Access Vector Caches:
                            1.  A kernel AVC that caches decisions by the  Security Server
                                on behalf of kernel based object managers.
                            2.  A userspace AVC built into libselinux that caches
                                decisions   when   SELinux-aware   applications   use
                                avc_open (3) with   avc_has_perm (3) or avc_has_perm_noaudit (3)
                                function calls. This will save kernel calls after the first decision has been
                                made.

Domain                      For SELinux this consists of one or more processes associated
                            to   the   type   component   of   a  Security   Context.  

Type Enforcement            rules   declared   in   Policy   describe   how   the
                            domain will interact with objects (see Object Class).

Linux Security Module       A  framework   that   provides  hooks   into  kernel  components
(LSM)                       (such as disk and network services) that can be utilised by
                            security   modules   (e.g.   SELinux   and   SMACK)   to   perform
                            access control checks.
                            Currently only one LSM module can be loaded, however work
                            is in progress to stack multiple modules).

Mandatory Access Control    An access control mechanisim enforced by the system. This
                            can be achieved by 'hard-wiring' the operating system and
                            applications (the bad old days - well good for some) or via a
                            policy that conforms to a  Policy. Examples of policy based
                            MAC are SELinux and SMACK.

Multi-Level Security (MLS)  Based   on   the   Bell-La   &   Padula   model   (BLP)   for
                            confidentiality in that (for example) a process running at a
                            'Confidential' level can read / write at their current level but
                            only read down levels or write up levels. While still used in
                            this way, it  is more commonly used for application separation
                            utilising the Multi-Category Security variant.

Object Class                Describes a resource such as files, sockets or services.
                            Each 'class' has relevant permissions associated to it such as
                            read,  write or export. This allows access to be enforced on the
                            instantiated object by their 

Object Manager              Userspace and kernel components that are responsible for the     
                            labeling, management (e.g. creation, access, destruction)  and
                            enforcement   of   the   objects   under   their   control.
                            Object Managers call the  Security Server for an access decision
                            based on a source and target Security Context (SID)), 
                            an Object Class and a set of permissions (or AV s). 
                            The Security Server will base its decision on whether the currently loaded Policy
                            will allow or deny access.  An  Object Manager may also call the   Security Server
                            to compute a new Security Context or SID for an object.
Policy                      A set of rules determining access rights. In SELinux these
                            rules are generally written in a kernel policy language using
                            either m4 (1) macro support (e.g. Reference Policy) or the
                            new CIL language. The Policy is then compiled into a binary
                            format for loading into the Security Server.

Role Based Access Control   SELinux users are associated to one or more roles, each role
                            may then be associated to one or more Domain types.

Security Server             A sub-system in the Linux kernel that makes access decisions
                            and computes security contexts based on Policy on behalf of
                            SELinux-aware applications and Object Managers.
                            The Security Server does not enforce a decision, it merely
                            states whether the operation is allowed or not according to the
                            Policy. It is  the  SELinux-aware  application  or Object
                            Manager responsibility to enforce the decision.

Security Context            An SELinux Security Context is a variable length string that
                            consists  of  the  following  mandatory  components
                            user:role:type and an optional [:range] component.
                            Generally abbreviated  to 'context', and sometimes  called a
                            'label'.

Security Identifier (SID)   SIDs are unique opaque integer values mapped by the kernel
                            Security Server and userspace AVC that represent a Security Context.
                            The SIDs generated by the kernel Security Server are u32
                            values that are  passed via the Linux Security Module
                            hooks to/from the kernel Object Managers.

Type Enforcement            SELinux makes use of a specific style of type enforcement
                            (TE) to enforce Mandatory Access Control. This is where all
                            subjects and objects have a type identifier associated to them
                            that can then be used to enforce rules laid down by 
                            Policy

   Juggling with labels
<pre xxxsmall zoom>
- SELinux aware tools (chcon, restorecon, ...)
- Contexts are set when file are created based on parent's directory
  by default. A Policy can define: 
  - """when app labeled 'foo_t'creates a
       file in a directory labeled 'bar_t', 
       transition to 'baz_t' label."""
    Ex. dhclient ('dhclient_t') creates a file /etc/resolv.conf
       labeled 'net_conf_t' in /etc ('etc_t')
- RPMs can set context at install time
- Login process sets a default context (unconfined for targeted policy)
- semanage can be used to maange settings for:
  - login, user, port, interface, module
  - node, file context, boolean, permissive state, dontaudit
</pre>

  <span bgorange>TYPE ENFORCEMENT</span>
<pre xxxsmall zoom>
- "Part of the policy that says:
   a process running with the label httpd_t can have read access
   to a file labeled httpd_config_t"

The sheer number of TE rules (~ "thousands") can make understanding 
policies challenging, but the rules themselves are not complex. 
There are a relatively few varieties, and they all fall into two 
basic categories: 
- access vector (AV): allow or audit access between two types.
  SYNTAX:
  | <b>allow</b> <b orange>src_domain</b> <b green>target_type</b>:<b blue>class</b> { <b green>permissions</b> };
  | ^
  | <b>Rule name: allow | dontaudit | auditallow | neverallow</b>
  | 
  | <b orange>src_domain</b>: the process domain , i.e, the type assigned to running process  
  | 
  | <b green>target_type</b>:<b blue>class</b> := Apply <b green>permission</b> to  <b blue>class</b> (file, FS, IPC, Shared Memory, ...) 
  | <b green>           </b>:tagged as <b green>target_type</b>
  | 
  | - tuple (<b orange>src_domain</b>,<b green>target_type</b>,<b blue>class</b>) is used as key in the hashtable.
  | - Two rules matching the same triplet key "merge" their permissions.
  | - Adding a new rule with a matching tripplet will also merge to existing perms.
  |   (There is no way then to delete permission, only to add)
  | 
  | <b green>permissions</b>: Any space-separated list of permissions that apply to the
  | <b green>           </b>: given  <b blue>class</b> (file, ...)



- type rules: control default labeling decisions under 
              certain circumstances. In particular they
              specify default types for objects created
              or relabeled at runtime

  SYNTAX:
  | Rule name        := type_transition | type_change
  | src_type(s)      type of the createing or owning process (current domain)
  | target_type(s)   type of the object contaning the new or relabeled object
  | object class(es) class(es)of object(s) being created or relabeled
  | Default type     The single default type for the new or relabeled object
  | Note: object class is not associated with the target type. 
  |       Instead, it refers to the objects that will be labeled with the
  |       default type.
  | Currently (WARN:2006), there are two forms of the type_transition rule.
  | - DEFAULT DOMAIN TRANSITION EVENTS:
  |   Ex:
  |   type_transition user_t passwd_exec_t : process passwd_t;
  |   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  |   """ when a process of type user_t executes a
  |       file of type passwd_exec_t, the process type
  |       will attempt to transition, by default, to
  |       passwd_t unless otherwise requested.""" <b>
  |   NOTICE:
  |   - The target type (passwd_exec_t) is implicitly 
  |     associated with the file-object-class when the stated
  |     object class is "process".
  |   - The stated object class (process) is associated 
  |     with the source and default types.</b>
  |   - The AV rules must also allow  at least three accesses:
  |      - execute The source type (init_t) must have execute 
  |        permission for files with the target type
  |        (apache_exec_t).
  |      - transition The source domain (init_t) must
  |        have transition permission to the default
  |        type (apache_t).
  |      - entrypoint The new (default) type (apache_t)
  |        must have entrypoint permission to files with
  |        the target type (apache_exec_t)
  |      Ex:
  |      type_transition init_t apache_exec_t : process apache_t;
  |      # Requires next "allow" Access Vector:
  |      allow init_t apache_exec_t : file execute;
  |      allow init_t apache_t      : process transition;
  |      allow apache_t apache_exec_t : file entrypoint;
  |
  |
  | - OBJECT TRANSITIONS TO SPECIFY DEFAULT OBJECT LABELING:
  |   (By default created objects receive the type of its "parent")
  | Ex:
  | type_transition passwd_t tmp_t : file passwd_tmp_t;
  | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  | """ when a process of type passwd_t creates an
  |   ordinary file (file object class) in a directory of 
  |   type tmp_t the file, by default, should have the 
  |   type passwd_tmp_t if allowed by the policy. """
  | NOTICE:

  Q: What an SELinux error means?:
<pre xxxsmall zoom>
 -A: It means:
     - labeling is wrong. 
       Fix examples:
       # chcon --reference /var/www/html /var/www/html/index.html
       ________________________________________________________
       # restorecon -vR    /var/www/html
         ^uses info from /etc/selinux/targeted/contexts/files/file_contexts, ... to determine what a file or dir's ctx should be
       ________________________________________________________
       # semanage fcontext -a -e /var/www/ /my/alternative/www/
       # restorecon -vR /my/alternative/www
       WARN: When we use semanage fcontext ctx we are just defining 
         what the context is, we are not writing what the extended 
         attributes are. We are just saying "when we do relable it 
         must look like this". restorecon must be run against the 
         directory to really relabel the new context.

     - Policy needs to be tweaked
       - booleans
        - policy modules
     - A bug in the policy (Open a ticket)
        STEP 1: put SELinux into "permissive" mode and run
                the application through all its paces to log all
                SELinux denials.
        # setenforce 0
        STEP 2: From /var/log/messages C&P proposed solution:
        # grep httpd /var/log/audit/audit.log | audit2allow -Mquirrellocal
                                                             ^generate new
                                                              policy file
        STEP 3: Import the new module

  <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-selinux-on-centos-7-part-3-users">SELinux users fine-tunning</a>
<pre xxxsmall zoom>
An important concept of SELinux is that TE rules associate privileges and accesses with programs, not users.
Users are not entirely ignored by SELinux. It is possible for the policy to specify multiple domain types (and thus differing sets of privilege) for the same program based on the user who runs the program. This allows for the concept of roles, which we discuss further in Chapter 6, âRoles and Users.â Nonetheless, the level of access control is still based on the programâs domain type and not the userâs privileges.


You do not create an SELinux user with a command, 
nor does it have its own login access to the server.
SELinux users are defined in the policy loaded into
memory at boot time, and there are only a few of these users.

- A user "enters a roll"           when policy grants it.
- A role "access a process domain" when policy grants it.

  <a href="http://blog.siphos.be/2015/07/restricting-even-root-access-to-a-folder/">Restricting root access to F.S.</a> 
<pre xxxsmall zoom>
(Date Sat 11 July 2015 By Sven Vermeulen Category SELinux)

- The use of a pre-existing policy means that some roles are already 
  identified and privileges are already granted to users - often these
  higher privileged roles are assigned to the Linux root user as not
  to confuse users. But that does mean that restricting root access to
  a folder means that some additional countermeasures need to be implemented.

STEP 01: Create new policy restricting access to /etc/private:
 policy_module(myprivate, 1.0)
 
 type <b orange>etc_private_t</b>;                 â type allowed to be used for files 
 fs_associate(<b orange>etc_private_t</b>)         â associate with file system
                                       Do NOT use the files_type() interface
                                       as this would assign a set of attributes
                                       that many user roles get read access on.
  allow sysadm_t <b orange>etc_private_t</b>:{dir file} relabelto;  *1

 *1: sysadm_t is now allowed to change ctx to etc_private_t:
     - administrator can label resources as etc_private_t 
       without having read access to these resources afterwards.
       Also, as long as there are no relabelfrom privileges assigned,
       the administrator cannot revert the context back to a
       type that he has read access to:
       ~ sudo chcon -t <b orange>etc_private_t</b> /etc/private


STEP 02:
- Administrators can still disable SELinux controls. Ex:
  # cat /etc/private/README
  â cat: /etc/private/README: Permission denied
  # setenforce 0
  # cat /etc/private/README
  â Hello World!

To prevent this:
  # setsebool secure_mode_policyload on
              ^                      ^
          prevent any policy and SELinux state manipulation
          !!!including permissive mode!!!, but also including
          loading additional SELinux policies or changing booleans.
          (experiment with this setting without persisting (-P)

WARN: Admin cannot access /etc/private location directly,
        but he might be able to access it indirectly, remounting the
        (non-critical) system and remounting with the context= option,
        overriding file-level contexts.
WARN: Admin can still reboot the system in a mode where he
      can access the file system regardless of SELinux controls 
      bootin with enforcing=0, editing /etc/selinux/config, ....
WARN: Admin can still access the block device files on which the 
      resources are directly. Specialized tools can allow for 
      extracting files and directories without actually (re)mounting
      the device.

You can still un-grant users and/oradmins the permissions to reboot the system,
    (re)mount file systems, access block devices, etc. 
    without leaving behind the policy that is already active.

|
| - certcli.sh makes use of a directory '.../private',
|   so  proper rights to asign `ca_private_key_t` to dirs must be in place.
| - /private directory's parent dir is labeled as `ca_misc_t` to allow

| An  ca_role() interface will be created to allow user domains 
| to use the CA script. Let's first create the ca_roles role attribute
| used by such interface: {
| attribute_role ca_roles; 
| role ca_roles types ca_cli_t;
| # }



NEXT: all that needed is to have an initial location marked as `ca_misc_t`
      For now, none of the users have the rights to do so, so I create
      three additional interfaces to be used against other user domains:

  - application domains are granted through interface
    application_type(), application_domain() or
    even userdom_user_application_domain(). 
    Election depends on the privileges you want to grant on the domain,

    the domain.

  Compiling new policy:
<a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/SELinux/Tutorials/Creating_your_own_policy_module_file">REF</a>

<pre xxxsmall zoom>
WARN: In some cases, you might need to update your policy to be compatible 
      with upstream SELinux policy changes. 

Tipical policy module (*.pp file) looks like:

localpolicy.pp 
*.te: type enforcement
*.fc: file contexts (optional)
*.if: interfaces (optional)


PRE-SETUP:
 $ sudo yum install -y selinux-policy-devel


<b>STEP 01: vim localpolicy.te:</b>

policy_module(localpolicy, 1.0)  â localpolicy must match localpolicy.te prefix
gen_require(`                    â backtick (`) denotes the start/end of the block 
  type user_t;                   â gen_require block is used to "reuse"reference policy,
  type var_log_t;                  and will be translated during the make -f ... command 
')                                 earlier on towards SELinux rules. 

allow user_t var_log_t:dir { getattr search open read };

<b>STEP 02: create SELinux policy module localpolicy.pp:</b>
# sudo make -f /usr/share/selinux/devel/Makefile localpolicy.pp

                                                          ^must "match"
                                                           localpolicy.te prefix


<b>STEP 03: Load the file:</b>
# sudo setenforce permissive
# sudo semodule -i /path/to/localpolicy.pp  
WARN: semodule does NOT need "-P". Will remain loaded after reboots.
(to disable use # sudo semodule -d localpolicy)

  Context Transition
<pre xxxsmall zoom >
proc_a @ contexta_t   â run app_x     â proc_b running @ contextb_t
                            â
                        entrypoint to
                         new context 

Ex:
#~ ls -Z /usr/sbin/vsftpd 
-r-x------ root root system_u:object_r:<b orange>ftpd_exec_t</b>:s0 /usr/sbin/vsftpd
                                       <b orange>^entrypoint</b> 
                                       <b orange>to  new    </b> 
                                       <b orange>context    </b>

#~ps -eZ  | egrep "(init_t|vsftpd)"
system_u:system_r:<b orange>init_t</b>:s0 ... systemd
system_u:system_r:<b orange>ftpd_t</b>:s0 ... vsftpd

 <b>Domain transition rules:</b>
 - source context "proc_a" must have execute permission for entrypoint (app_x)
 - "app_x" file context must be identified as an entrypoint for the target domain
 - original domain (contexta_t) must be allowed to transition to the target domain (contextb_t)
  In the previous example:
  STEP 01: Check source domain <b orange>init_t</b> have execute permission on
  ftpd_exec_t entrypoint:
    #~ sesearch -s init_t -t ftpd_exec_t -c file -p execute -Ad
    â allow init_t ftpd_exec_t : file { read getattr execute open } ;
   
  STEP 02: Check binary file is entrypoint for the target domain <b orange>ftpd_t</b>:
    #~ <b>se</b>search -s <b orange>ftpd_t</b> \
         -t <b orange>ftpd_exec_t</b> -c file \
         -p <b green>entrypoint</b> -Ad
    â allow ftpd_t ftpd_exec_t : file { ioctl read getattr lock execute execute_no_trans <b green>entrypoint</b> open } ;

  STEP 03: Check source domain init_t have transition permission to target ftpd_t:
    #~ <b>se</b>search -s <b orange>init_t</b> -t <b orange>ftpd_t</b> \
          -c process -p transition -Ad
    â allow init_t ftpd_t : process transition ;
</pre>

  Workflow
<pre xxxsmall zoom>
- Switch to permisive mode.
- Test new policy.
- Check violations in logs (See troubleshooting with audit2allow to produce new rules)
</pre>
    

  Verify current file  against file_context(.local) ddbb 
<pre xxxsmall zoom >
#~ matchpathcon -V /www/html/index.html # -V: Verify
In case of mismatch an error similar to next one will be displayed:

Multilevel Security (MLS)
<pre xxxsmall zoom>
~ ls -Z /etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf
-rw-------. root root system_u:object_r:etc_t:s0       /etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf

The sensitivity is part of the hierarchical multilevel security mechanism. By hierarchy, we mean the levels of sensitivity can go deeper and deeper for more secured content in the file system. Level 0 (depicted by s0) is the lowest sensitivity level, comparable to say, "public." There can be other sensitivity levels with higher s values: for example, internal, confidential, or regulatory can be depicted by s1, s2, and s3 respectively. This mapping is not stipulated by the policy: system administrators can configure what each sensitivity level mean.

When a SELinux enabled system uses MLS for its policy type (configured in the /etc/selinux/config file), it can mark certain files and processes with certain levels of sensitivity. The lowest level is called "current sensitivity" and the highest level is called "clearance sensitivity".

Going hand-in-hand with sensitivity is the category of the resource, depicted by c. Categories can be considered as labels assigned to a resource. Examples of categories can be department names, customer names, projects etc. The purpose of categorization is to further fine-tune access control. For example, you can mark certain files with confidential sensitivity for users from two different internal departments.

For SELinux security contexts, sensitivity and category work together when a category is implemented. When using a range of sensitivity levels, the format is to show sensitivity levels separated by a hyphen (for example, s0-s2). When using a category, a range is shown with a dot in between. Sensitivity and category values are separated by a colon (:).

Here is an example of sensitivity / category pair:

user_u:object_r:etc_t:s0:c0.c2  

There is only one sensitivity level here and that's s0. The category level could also be written as c0-c2.

So where do you assign your category levels? Let's find the details from the /etc/selinux/targeted/setrans.conf file:

cat /etc/selinux/targeted/setrans.conf

#
# Multi-Category Security translation table for SELinux
#
#
# Objects can be categorized with 0-1023 categories defined by the admin.
# Objects can be in more than one category at a time.
# Categories are stored in the system as c0-c1023.  Users can use this
# table to translate the categories into a more meaningful output.
# Examples:
# s0:c0=CompanyConfidential
# s0:c1=PatientRecord
# s0:c2=Unclassified
# s0:c3=TopSecret
# s0:c1,c3=CompanyConfidentialRedHat
s0=SystemLow
s0-s0:c0.c1023=SystemLow-SystemHigh
s0:c0.c1023=SystemHigh

We won't go into the details of sensitivities and categories here. Just know that a process is allowed read access to a resource only when its sensitivity and category level is higher than that of the resource (i.e. the process domain dominates the resource type). The process can write to the resource when its sensitivity/category level is less than that of the resource.
Conclusion

We have tried to cover a broad topic on Linux security in the short span of this three-part-series. If we look at our system now, we have a simple Apache web server installed with its content being served from a custom directory. We also have an FTP daemon running in our server. There were a few users created whose access have been restricted. As we went along, we used SELinux packages, files, and commands to cater to our security needs. Along the way we also learned how to look at SELinux error messages and make sense of them.

Entire books have been written on the SELinux topic and you can spend hours trying to figure out different packages, configuration files, commands, and their effects on security. So where do you go from here?

One thing I would do is caution you not to test anything on a production system. Once you have mastered the basics, start playing with SELinux by enabling it on a test replica of your production box. Make sure the audit daemons are running and keep an eye on the error messages. Check any denials preventing services from starting. Play around with the boolean settings. Make a list of possible steps for securing your system, like creating new users mapped to least-privilged SELinux accounts or applying the right context to non-standard file locations. Understand how to decipher an error log. Check the ports for various daemons: if non-standard ports are used, make sure they are correctly assigned to the policy.

It will all come together with time and practice. :)

 As processes and objects are created and destroyed, they either:
1.  Inherit their labels from the parent process or object.
2.  The policy type, role and range transition statements allow a different label to
     be assigned as discussed in the Domain and Object Transitions section.
3.  SELinux-aware   applications   can   enforce   a   new   label   
    (with   the   policies approval of course) using the libselinux API functions.
4.  An object manager (OM) can enforce a default label that can either be built
    into the OM or obtained via a configuration file (such as those used by X-Windows).
5.  Use an 'initial security identifier' (or initial SID). These are defined in all 
    base and monolithic policies and are used to either set an initial context during the
    boot process, or if an object requires a default (i.e. the object does not already
    have a valid context).


The labeling of file systems that implement extended attributes
is supported by SELinux using:
1.  The  fs_use_xattr statement   within   the   policy   to   identify   what   file
  systems use extended attributes. This statement is used to inform the security
  server how to label the filesystem.
2.  A 'file contexts' file that defines what the initial contexts should be for each
   file and directory within the filesystem. The format of this file is described in
   the modules/active/file_contexts.template file section.
3.  A method to initialise the filesystem with these extended attributes. This is
   achieved by SELinux utilities such as fixfiles(8) and setfiles(8) .
   There   are   also   commands   such   as  chcon(1),  restorecon(8) and
   restorecond(8) that can be used to relabel files
