  The hidepid option in the procfs defines how much info about processes we want to be available for non-owners. 
  <ul>
  <li>hidepid=0 : (default old behavior), anybody may read all world-readable /proc/PID/* files</li>
  <li>hidepid=1 : users may not access any /proc/ / directories, but their own.  
    Sensitive files like cmdline, sched*, status 
    are now protected against other users
  </li>
  <li>hidepid=2 : equals to hidepid=1 plus :
    - /proc/PID/  will be invisible to other users.
      It complicates intruder's task of gathering info
      about running processes, whether some daemon
      runs with elevated privileges, whether another user
      runs some sensitive program, whether other users run any 
      program at all, etc.Linux kernel protection: </li>
  </ul>
    Ex:
<pre {>
# mount -o remount,rw,hidepid=2 /proc
Alternatively edit /etc/fstab:
proc  /proc  proc defaults,hidepid=2  0   0

DeviceKit-power latency control
Use cases:
    I want my IM application to request 0.5s latency for messages
    I’m running an OpenGL simulation and want maximum performance, even on battery
    I’m running an SQL server for a credit card company, and want the server to request low latency CPU and network as any delay costs money
    I’m an admin, and want to change the power consumption vs. latency from cron scripts so it uses high latency during the night for maximum power saving, and low latency during business hours.
    I want high throughput when copying files, but want low throughput for downloading updates in the background.
    I want my power manager to set all latencies to lowest when on AC power
    I don’t want my users messing with latency settings
    I’m and admin and I want to be able to override all latency settings on my machines

https://upower.freedesktop.org/

 UPower is an abstraction for enumerating power devices, listening to device events and querying history and statistics. Any application or service on the system can access the org.freedesktop.UPower service via the system message bus. Some operations (such as suspending the system) are restricted using PolicyKit.

UPower was once called DeviceKit-power. UPower aims to make a large chunk of HAL redundant, as HAL is officially deprecated.

UPower is also useful to control the latency of different operations on your computer, which enables you to save significant amounts of power. Nothing much uses this interface yet, but this is a classic chicken and egg scenario, and I think it's important to encourage the egg to lay a chicken. Please report any problems to the Freedesktop bugzilla or send a mail to the DeviceKit mailing list for discussion.

A dream come true: Android is finally using DRM/KMS

In the beginning, Android did not really have a graphics stack. It was just pushing frames directly to framebuffers and hoping for the best, the approach worked for quite some time.

However, over time, the usecases became more and more complex and a new graphics stack was necessary. About 6 years ago the Android team conducted a lot of research and quickly realized that the mainline kernel was far from being up to the job - it was lacking Atomic screen updates, explicit syncronization and support for low power hardware, among other things. Google was left with no other choice than to design their own graphic stack: Atomic Display Framework (ADF).

That was another piece of the mainline linux kernel that Android forked, but it allowed Google to overcome the challenges brought on by the new needs of industry and customers.

The mainline graphics stack had a number of problems and the API was outdated and not keeping pace with the industry. The mainline graphics community knew it was time for an upgrade!
Atomic Modeset

The addition of Kernel Modeset (KMS) around 2008 was a revolution in itself, but as time passed, new needs arose and a new API was required. That lead to a situation where we had different syscalls to update every single buffer on the screen. In order to update the whole screen, for example, one would need to make a couple of syscalls and hope they would all be applied to the display hardware before the next vsync signal, otherwise some user noticeable flickering could happen. Unfortunately, such flickering was happening quite often.

Led by Daniel Vetter (Intel), the introduction of Atomic Modesetting on top of KMS in 2015 added a new system call that would contain *all* the information to update all buffers in all screens in a single commit transaction, fixing the issues that plagued the previous API. The Direct Rendering Manager (DRM) Core went through a comprehensive refactoring process, and drivers became much easier to write, allowing for all the major drivers to be eventually ported to atomic modesetting, and many more added as well, some of them with Collabora's help.
Explicit Synchronization

Atomic Modeset was a giant step but there was still one piece missing: Explicit Synchronization. To avoid screen stalls and lack of knowledge about the current state of a buffer, ADF from Android introduced sync fences to keep track of buffer state and signal when GPU or Display is done filling or scanning it out.

In work led by Collabora, the Android Sync Framework was refactored and added to the mainline kernel, and Explicit Synchronization support was coded into DRM Atomic Modeset. The kernel now had all the pieces to support Android running on DRM/KMS.
A new reality

The dream finally came true in 2018 with the release of the Google Pixel 3, the first Android phone running with the mainline graphics stack. A feat that was deemed impossible 10 years ago is now a reality thanks to a lot of hard work from the entire community.

Google ChromeOS also benefited from Explicit Synchronization to improve support for Android apps on Chromebooks, and now the Chrome Browser also has Explicit Synchronization support.

As more vendors start to push their code to mainline, and follow upstream closely, we expect others Android phone vendors to switch to DRM/KMS too in the future. The upstream stack is now quite modern and robust, and the benefits of using it is becoming clear!
