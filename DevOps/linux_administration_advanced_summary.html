  <span xbig>Hidding processes to other Users: <a href="http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/linux-hide-processes-from-other-users/">REF</a></span> <br/>
  The hidepid option in the procfs defines how much info about processes we want to be available for non-owners. 
  <ul>
  <li>hidepid=0 : (default old behavior), anybody may read all world-readable /proc/PID/* files</li>
  <li>hidepid=1 : users may not access any /proc/ / directories, but their own.  
    Sensitive files like cmdline, sched*, status 
    are now protected against other users
  </li>
  <li>hidepid=2 : equals to hidepid=1 plus :
    - /proc/PID/  will be invisible to other users.
      It complicates intruder's task of gathering info
      about running processes, whether some daemon
      runs with elevated privileges, whether another user
      runs some sensitive program, whether other users run any 
      program at all, etc.Linux kernel protection: </li>
  </ul>
    Ex:
<pre {>
# mount -o remount,rw,hidepid=2 /proc
Alternatively edit /etc/fstab:
proc  /proc  proc defaults,hidepid=2  0   0
</pre }>

DeviceKit-power latency control
Use cases:
    I want my IM application to request 0.5s latency for messages
    I’m running an OpenGL simulation and want maximum performance, even on battery
    I’m running an SQL server for a credit card company, and want the server to request low latency CPU and network as any delay costs money
    I’m an admin, and want to change the power consumption vs. latency from cron scripts so it uses high latency during the night for maximum power saving, and low latency during business hours.
    I want high throughput when copying files, but want low throughput for downloading updates in the background.
    I want my power manager to set all latencies to lowest when on AC power
    I don’t want my users messing with latency settings
    I’m and admin and I want to be able to override all latency settings on my machines

https://upower.freedesktop.org/

 UPower is an abstraction for enumerating power devices, listening to device events and querying history and statistics. Any application or service on the system can access the org.freedesktop.UPower service via the system message bus. Some operations (such as suspending the system) are restricted using PolicyKit.

UPower was once called DeviceKit-power. UPower aims to make a large chunk of HAL redundant, as HAL is officially deprecated.

UPower is also useful to control the latency of different operations on your computer, which enables you to save significant amounts of power. Nothing much uses this interface yet, but this is a classic chicken and egg scenario, and I think it's important to encourage the egg to lay a chicken. Please report any problems to the Freedesktop bugzilla or send a mail to the DeviceKit mailing list for discussion.
