  <b>Filesystem Basics</b>
  Moving around FS
<pre xxxsmall zoom>
<b>Display current working directory</b>
$ pwd  # pwd: "P"rint "W"orking "D"irectory
<b>Change to directory</b>
$ cd /home/myUser/Dowload

<b>(ls "file or directory") List "file" or "files in directory"</b>
With no file or directory list info in current working directory
ls -l :  ("long"), show permissions, file size, modification date, ownership
ls -a :  ("all" ), shows also hidden files (files/dirs starting with ".") 
ls -d :  Show only directory entry, do NOT display directory contents 
ls -F :  ("format") append helper graphical symbol like '*' for executable files
ls -S :  sort by size output in descending order
ls -R :  ("recursive") list recursively children directories

</pre>

  handling files/dirs
<pre xxxsmall zoom>
<b>Create directory</b>
mkdir -p /home/myUser/work/project01 # -p: will create any non-existing directory up to project01
                                     #     Withouth -p mkdir will fail if /home/myUser/work does not exists

<b>Moving files</b>
$ mv /my/path01/myFile1  /my/path02/   # move myFile1 from path01 to path02 directory
<b>Rename file</b>
$ mv myOriginalName  myFinalName   # use the mv (move) command to rename
<b>copying files</b>
$ cp    /tmp/fileToCopy       /home/myUser/ # copy to destination directory
$ cp -R /tmp/directoryToCopy  /home/myUser/ # copy recursively (-R) directory to destination directory


<b>Remove files/directories</b>
$ rm -f file       # force (-f) file deletion.  The -f option is useful for automated scripts
$ rm -rf directory # force (-f) directory deletion recursively (-r). Do not ask before deleting
                   # Be very careful with recursive deletions. Specially as root user

<b>Securely remove files by overwriting first</b>
$ shred -n 2 -z -v /tmp/myImportantSecret  # -n 2: Overwrite twice with random data
                                           # finally write over with zeroes (-z)
                                           # -v: Show progress

  Hard/Soft Links
<pre xxxsmall zoom>
In unix an "inode" is the low-level structure that stores the physical location in disk of
a given file. This "inode" is not visible to the user. 
The user visible entities are the file system paths, that point to the real inodes.

When a new file is created we have an structure similar to:

   /my/file/path  (points to)  → inode   (points to) →  physical_block_on_disk
   ^visible in              ^invisible to               ^managed by hard-disk
    user shells,             users, managed              internal circuitry
    GUI explorers,...        by the OS kernel            (or networks NAS)

* We can create <b>symbolic links</b> to a file_path, that are "sortcuts" to access
  a file_path from another file_path like (ln -s):
  
     $ ln -s /my/file/path   /my/newLocation/file/path/symLink
     
      This will leave and structure similar to:
     
        /my/file/path   →  inode   →  physical_block_on_disk
         ↑
         │
        /my/newLocation/file/path/symLink
     
     If the original /my/file/path is deleted or moved the links is broken.
  
  
* A hard-link can also be created pointing direcly to the inode, like (ln):
     $ ln /my/file/path   /my/newLocation/file/path2

      This will leave and structure similar to:
     
        /my/file/path   
                                    →  inode   →  physical_block_on_disk
        /my/newLocation/file/path2

The underlying inode will increase the number of references. The file data can be
accesses independently by the original /my/file/path or the new /my/newLocation/file/path2.
The inode (file) wil exists until all hardlinks or references are deleted.

The "stat" command can be used to inspect inodes and other advanced info for a given
file path.

  Searching files/data
<pre xxxsmall zoom>
<b><a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/find">find</a> files whose name ends in "html"</b>
Ex 1: "complex" find 
Command             |   Human explanation
(split into lines   |
 for readability)   |
------------------- +--------------------
$ find              |   let's display find results
   /var/lib         | ←     starting in this base directory and subdirectories
   -type f          | ← AND of type file (ignore directories, links, ...)
   -iname "*html"   | ← AND whose name matches *html (iname:ignore case, name: case sensitive)
   -mmin  -30       | ← AND whose modification time is 30 or less (-30) minutes (-mmin)
   -msize +20k      | ← AND whose size (msize) is 20kilobytes or more (+20)

    - buffers are associated with a specific block device, 
      caching filesystem metadata(dir contents, file permissions),
      as tracking in-flight pages (what's being written
      from or read to for a particular block device). 
    - cache only contains parked file data (file content)

Director Daemon supervises all the backup, restore, verify and archive operations.
Sysadmin uses Director to schedule backups and to recover files..

Console service allows the administrator or user to communicate with the Director
(three versions: text-based, QT-based, wxWidgets)

File Daemon It's installed on the machine to be backed up and is responsible for 
providing the file attributes and data when requested by the Director
as well as for the file system dependent part of restoring the file attributes and data 
during a recovery operation.

Storage daemons are software programs in charge of storage and recovery of the 
file attributes and data to the physical backup media or volumes. In other words, it is 
responsible for reading and writing your tapes (or other storage media, e.g. files)

Catalog Services are responsible for maintaining the file indexes and 
volume databases for all files backed up allowing sysadmin or user to
quickly locate and restore any desired file. The Catalog services sets
Bacula apart from simple backup programs like tar and bru, because the catalog
maintains a record of all Volumes used, all Jobs run, and all Files saved, permitting
efficient restoration and Volume management. Bacula currently supports three different 
databases, MySQL, and PostgreSQL one of which must be chosen when building Bacula.

Monitor Service Allows the administrator or user to watch current status of Directors,
File Daemons and Bacula Storage Daemons. Currently, only a GTK+ version is available.

<pre xxxsmall zoom>
By default we can use next tools like:
   $ tool inputFile   # Apply to given file
or
   $ command1 ... | tool1 | tool2 | tool3 # Use stdout from previous command (|) as input 

sorting content:
$ sort file1  ← Sorting alphabetically lines in file  (-r to reverse, -g for numerical sort)
j
$ sort file1 -t ':' -k 4 -k 1    ← Use ':' as separator, sort first by column 4, then column 1.

$ join file1 file2    ← Join two lines together assuming they share at least one common value
                        on the relevant line, skiping lines withouth common value.

Cut by column:
$ cut -d "," -f 1,3,7 file1.csv ← Use "," as column delimiter, show then columns 1,3,7
$ cut -c 1-50         file.txt  ← show characters 1 to 50 in each line
$ cut -5, 8, 20-      file.txt  ← show characters 1 to 5 and 8 and from 20 to the end

        This would display (“cut”) characters (columns) 1 to 5, 8 and from 20 to the end.

$ uniq file1     ←  Eliminates duplicate entries from a file
                    Commonly used with sort like:
                    $ cat file.txt | sort | uniq
                    Options: -c: display number of occurances of each duplicate
                             -u: list only unique entries
                             -d: list only duplicate entries

$ tr "u" "d" file1  ← translate all instances of characters in a text file
$  cat some_file | tr '[A-Z]' '[a-z]' > new_file  ← Convert all capital letters to lowercase

$ nl file1.txt  ← Display file1.txt to STDOUT prefixing with line numbers

$ sed "s/<b green>up</b>/<b orange>down</b>/<b blue>g</b>" file1.txt ← Replaces "<b green>up</b>" by "<b orange>down</b>". "<b blue>g</b>" flags indicates to replace all ocurrences. Otherwise only first is replaced.

AVAILABLE COMMANDS:
<a href="https://dnf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command_ref.html#autoremove-command-label">autoremove</a>
    Removes all "leaf" packages from the system that were originally 
    installed as dependencies of user-installed packages but which are no 
    longer required by any such package.
<a href="https://dnf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command_ref.html#check-command-label">check</a>
    Checks the local packagedb and produces information on any problems it 
    finds. You can pass the check command the options “–dependencies”, “–
    duplicates”, “–obsoleted” or “–provides”, to limit the checking that is 
    performed (the default is “all” which does all).
<a href="https://dnf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command_ref.html#check-update-command-label">check-update</a>
    Non-interactively checks if updates of the specified packages are 
    available. If no <package-specs> are given, checks whether any updates at 
    all are available for your system. DNF exit code will be 100 when there 
    are updates available and a list of the updates will be printed, 0 if not and 1 if an error occurs.

    Please note that having a specific newer version available for an 
    installed package (and reported by check-update) does not imply that 
    subsequent dnf upgrade will install it. The difference is that dnf 
    upgrade must also ensure the satisfiability of all dependencies and other restrictions.

    Output is affected by config option autocheck_running_kernel

<a href="https://dnf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command_ref.html#clean-command-label">clean</a>
    Performs cleanup of temporary files kept for repositories. This includes any 
    such data left behind from disabled or removed repositories as well as 
    for different distribution release 
    versions.
<a href="https://dnf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command_ref.html#distro-sync-command-label">distro-sync</a>
    As necessary upgrades, downgrades or keeps selected installed packages to 
    match the latest version available from any enabled repository. If no 
    package is given, all installed packages are considered.
<a href="https://dnf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command_ref.html#downgrade-command-label">downgrade</a>
    Downgrades the specified packages to the highest installable package of all 
    known lower versions if possible. When version is given and is lower than 
    version of installed package then it downgrades to target version.
<a href="https://dnf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command_ref.html#group-command-label">group</a>
    Groups are virtual collections of packages. DNF keeps track of groups 
    that the user selected (“marked”) installed and can manipulate the 
    comprising packages with simple commands.  (See only manual for more info)
<a href="https://dnf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command_ref.html#help-command-label">help</a>
<a href="https://dnf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command_ref.html#history-command-label">history</a>
   The history command allows the user to view what has happened in past 
    transactions and act according to this information (assuming the history_record configuration option is set).
<a href="https://dnf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command_ref.html#info-command-label">info</a>
     list description and summary information about installed and available packages.
<a href="https://dnf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command_ref.html#install-command-label">install</a>
    DNF makes sure that the given packages and their dependencies are 
    installed on the system. Each <spec> can be either a <package-spec>, or a 
    @<group-spec>. See Install Examples. If a given package or provide cannot 
    be (and is not already) installed, the exit code will be non-zero.

    When <package-spec> that specify exact version of the package is given, 
    DNF will install the desired version, no matter which version of the 
    package is already installed. The former version of the package will be 
    removed in the case of non-installonly package.

    There are also a few specific install commands install-n, install-na and 
    install-nevra that allow the specification of an exact argument in NEVRA 
    format.

    dnf install tito
        Install package tito (tito is package name).
    dnf install ~/Downloads/tito-0.6.2-1.fc22.noarch.rpm
        Install local rpm file tito-0.6.2-1.fc22.noarch.rpm from ~/Downloads/ directory.
    dnf install tito-0.5.6-1.fc22
        Install package with specific version. If the package is already 
        installed it will automatically try to downgrade or upgrade to specific version.
    dnf --best install tito
        Install the latest available version of package. If the package is 
        already installed it will automatically try to upgrade to the latest 
        version. If the latest version of package cannot be installed, the installation fail.
    dnf install vim
        DNF will automatically recognize that vim is not a package name, but 
        provide, and install a package that provides vim with all required 
        dependencies. Note: Package name match has precedence over package provides match.
    dnf install https://kojipkgs.fedoraproject.org//packages/tito/0.6.0/1.fc22/noarch/tito-0.6.0-1.fc22.noarch.rpm
        Install package directly from URL.
    dnf install '@Web Server'
        Install environmental group ‘Web Server’
    dnf install /usr/bin/rpmsign
        Install a package that provides /usr/bin/rpmsign file.
    dnf -y install tito --setopt=install_weak_deps=False
        Install package tito (tito is package name) without weak deps. Weak 
        deps are not required for core functionality of the package, but they 
        enhance the original package (like extended documentation, plugins, 
        additional functions, …). 
<a href="https://dnf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command_ref.html#list-command-label">list</a>
    Dumps lists of packages depending on the packages’ relation to the system
    . A package is installed if it is present in the RPMDB, and it is 
    available if it is not installed but it is present in a repository that 
    DNF knows about. The list command can also limit the displayed packages 
    according to other criteria, e.g. to only those that update an installed 
    package. The exclude option in configuration file (.conf) might influence 
    the result, but if the command line option --disableexcludes is used, it 
    ensure that all installed packages will be listed
<a href="https://dnf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command_ref.html#makecache-command-label">makecache</a>
    dnf [options] makecache
        Downloads and caches in binary format metadata for all known repos. 
        Tries to avoid downloading whenever possible (e.g. when the local 
        metadata hasn’t expired yet or when the metadata timestamp hasn’t changed).
    dnf [options] makecache --timer
        Like plain makecache but instructs DNF to be more resource-aware, 
        meaning will not do anything if running on battery power and will 
        terminate immediately if it’s too soon after the last successful 
        makecache run (see dnf.conf(5), metadata_timer_sync). 
<a href="https://dnf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command_ref.html#mark-command-label">mark</a>
    dnf mark install <package-specs>...

    dnf [options] repoquery [<select-options>] [<query-options>] [<pkg-spec>]
        Searches the available DNF repositories for selected packages and 
        displays the requested information about them. It is an equivalent of rpm 
        -q for remote repositories.
    dnf [options] repoquery --querytags
        Provides list of recognized tags by repoquery option --queryformat
        There are also a few specific repoquery commands repoquery-n, 
        repoquery-na and repoquery-nevra that allow the specification of an exact 
        argument in NEVRA format (does not affect arguments of options like –

    Search package metadata for the keywords. Keywords are matched as case-
    insensitive substrings, globbing is supported. By default lists packages 
    that match all requested keys (AND operation). Keys are searched in 
    package names and summaries. If option “–all” is used, lists packages 
    that match at least one of keys (OR operation). And in addition keys are 
    searched in package descriptions and URLs. The result is sorted from the 
    most relevant results to the least.

$ sudo apt-get  install ubuntu-desktop  "package2" ... (-s to simulate)
$ sudo aptitude install ubuntu-desktop  ← Ncurses variant


$ sudo auto-apt run "./configure" ← runs "command_string", installing uninstalled packages when possible.
  ^ keeps databases up-to-date by calling:
    $ auto-apt update
    $ auto-apt updatedb
    $ auto-apt update-local

$ apt-get update ← Run periodically and after modifications to /etc/apt/*

$ apt-get upgrade ← upgrade all installed packages.

$ apt-get dist-upgrade ← same as upgrade, except add the "smart upgrade" checkbox.
                         It tells APT to use "smart" conflict resolution system,
                         and <b>it will attempt to upgrade the most important packages

                         ¡¡¡does not upgrade from a previous version of Ubuntu!!!

<b>Diagnostics:</b>
$ apt-get check    ← update package lists and checks for broken dependencies

<b>Cleaning/Removal</b>
$ sudo apt-get autoclean  ← removes .deb files for packages that are no longer
                            installed on your system. (Can save space in /var/cache/apt/archives)
$ apt-get clean           ← same as autoclean, except it removes all packages from the package cache.

$ sudo apt-get remove "package_name" ← keeps  configuration files 
$ sudo apt-get purge  "package_name" ← Remove configuration files

$ apt-get autoremove     ← removes packages no longer needed

<b>Troubleshooting</b>
$ sudo apt-get -f install  ← Fix Broken Packages (system complains about "unmet dependencies")

$ dpkg-reconfigure "package_name"


$ echo "'package_name' hold" | \  ← Put package_name on hold
  sudo dpkg --set-selections        may have the unintended side effect of preventing upgrades
                                    to packages that depend on updated versions of the pinned package.
                                    apt-get dist-upgrade will override this, but will warn you first.

<b>Search commands</b>
$ apt-cache search "search_term" ← lists packages matching in name or description

$ dpkg -l *"search_term"*  ← find packages whose names contain "search_term".

                                    with the name of the package they came from. 
                                    Its equivalent to the slower (but installed by default):

  sudo apt-file search \"filepath_pattern"
<b>Package Info</b>
$ apt-cache show "package_name"  ← shows the description of "package_name", version, size, dependencies and conflicts.
$ dpkg -L "package_name"         ← list files in package
$ dpkg -c foo.deb                ← lists files in the manually downloaded package "./foo.deb".

$ apt-cache pkgnames             ← provides a list of every package in the system

  <a href="https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Alpine_Linux_package_management"><code>apk</code></a> (Alpine/"Docker")
<pre xxxsmall zoom>
Because Alpine Linux is designed to run from RAM, package management involves two phases:

- Installing / Upgrading / Deleting packages on a running system.
- Restoring a system to a previously configured state 
  (e.g. after reboot), including all previously installed packages 
  and locally modified configuration files. (RAM-Based Installs Only)

- apk is the tool used to install, upgrade, or delete software on a running sytem.
- lbu is the tool used to capture the data necessary to 
  restore a system to a previously configured state.

Overview

apk: 
  add      Add new packages to the running system
  del      Delete packages from the running system
  fix      Attempt to repair or upgrade an installed package
  update   Update the index of available packages
  info     Prints information about installed or available packages
  search   Search for packages or descriptions with wildcard patterns
  upgrade  Upgrade the currently installed packages
  cache    Maintenance operations for locally cached package repository
  version  Compare version differences between installed and available packages
  index    create a repository index from a list of packages
  fetch    download (but not install) packages
  audit    List changes to the file system from pristine package install state
  verify   Verify a package signature
  dot      Create a graphviz graph description for a given package
  policy   Display the repository that updates a given 
           package, plus repositories that also offer the package
  stats    Display statistics, including number of 
           packages installed and available, number of 
           directories and files, etc.
  manifest Display checksums for files contained in a given package


- Software packages for Alpine Linux are digitally signed 
  tar.gz archives with ".apk" extension (often called "a-packs")
  stored in one or more repositories (directory with a collection of *.apk files
  and a APKINDEX.tar.gz index )

- The list of repositories to check is stored in /etc/apk/repositories
  (one repo per line)
  Ex:
  /media/sda1/apks
  http://nl.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.7/community
  <b blue>@edge</b> http://nl.alpinelinux.org/alpine/edge/main
  <b blue>@edgecommunity</b> http://nl.alpinelinux.org/alpine/edge/community
  <b blue>@testing</b> http://nl.alpinelinux.org/alpine/edge/testing
  ^ "tagged" repo
    will be used like
    # apk add stableapp newapp@<b blue>edge</b> bleedingapp@<b blue>testing</b>
    by default only untagged repositories are used

Update the Package list
  # apk update (Fill catch locally the latest APKINDEX.tar.gz from remote repos)

Add Packages (transitive dependencies is automatic):
  # apk add openssh openntp vim

Add a packager from dev. repository (dangerous):
  # apk add cherokee --update-cache \
    --repository http://dl-3.alpinelinux.org/alpine/edge/testing/
    --allow-untrusted

Add local Package
  # apk add --allow-untrusted /path/to/file.apk


Remove a Package

  # apk del openssh

Upgrade a Running System

  # apk update
  # apk upgrade

To upgrade only a few packages, use the add command with the -u or --upgrade option:

apk update
apk add --upgrade busybox 
Note: Remember that when you reboot your machine, the remote repository will not be available until after networking is started. This means packages newer than your local boot media will likely not be installed after a reboot. To make an "upgrade" persist over a reboot, use a local cache.
Search for Packages


Search:
 # apk search -v        ← list all packages along with descriptions
 # apk search -v 'acf*' ← list all packages part of the ACF system
 # apk search -v --description 'NTP' ← list all packages that list NTP as 
                                       part of their description, 

Information on Packages
  # apk info -a zlib ← -w: show just webpage info
                       -a: show          all info

It looks like date is simply reporting an error that it received from
the operating system.   The strace utility (or some platform-specific
replacement if you are not using Linux) should be able to confirm
this.

This is almost certainly because the date program understands the date
you refer to, but failed in its attempt to set the system clock to
that value.

More likely it's because CET is 1h ahead of UTC and therefore the time
you specified is before the Epoch.    But Eric already said that, so
perhaps you ruled out that possibility but did not say so.

List and sort the versions available in
your repo:

YUM: sorting by version number:                    | APT:
                                                   | 
$ yum list docker-ce --showduplicates | sort -r    | apt-cache madison docker-ce

yum upgrade forces the removal of obsolete packages, while yum update may or may not also do this. The removal of obsolete packages can be risky, as it may remove packages that you use.

This makes yum update the safer option.

From man yum:

    update

    If run without any packages, update will update every currently installed package. If one or more packages or package globs are specified, Yum will only update the listed packages. While updating packages, yum will ensure that all dependencies are satisfied. (See Specifying package names for more information) If the packages or globs specified match to packages which are not currently installed then update will not install them. update operates on groups, files, provides and filelists just like the "install" command. If the main obsoletes configure option is true (default) or the --obsoletes flag is present yum will include package obsoletes in its calculations - this makes it better for distro-version changes, for example: upgrading from somelinux 8.0 to somelinux 9.

    upgrade

    Is the same as the update command with the --obsoletes flag set. See update for more details
