  <span>Linux Basics</span>
<pre xxxsmall zoom>
- Linux itself is just an OS kernel in charge of sharing the (limited) hardware
  resources amongst potentially many running tasks and users working simultaneously
  on the systems. More preciselly, the main tasks in charge of kernel control are:

  - Orchestate(schedule) how much time each running-task is allowed to
    run on each CPU before such task is put on stand-by to let
    another task proffit from such CPU. 

  - Assign which process has access to the (limited)
    RAM memory on the system and move data on RAM used by stand-by processes
    to secondory storage (disks) in case of RAM space shortage. 

  - Provide support for users and permissions, so that different users will
    be able to isolate and protect its data from other users.

  Kernel control is transparent to running tasks or processes, so user-space task
  will run with the perception that they run alone in its own CPU and with
  all available memory for themself. When the kernel puts them on-hold 
  such tasks will be freezed and once restarted it will NOT notice any 
  change to the state before being put on-hold. Only the kernel is aware of
  the complex trickeries needed to make tasks run in parallel and isolated
  from each other. 

  Other important tasks offered by the kernel are:
  
 - Abstract the running hardware into standarized interfaces, so 
   user application will not need to work differently with different hardware.
   For example an application will ask the kernel to write data to the disk and
   the kernel will take care of the internal difference between the miriads
   of diferent disk hardware technologies.

 - Provide an easy-to-use file-system to work with data on disk, so that apps
   can orginized data in terms of files and directories, instead of just
   bunch-of-bytes on the hard-disk.

 - Provide network communication and support for standard network protocols
   like TCP/UP, bluetooth, WiFI, ... so that each app does not need to reimplement
   them.

 - Provide mechanisms to allow two running tasks to communicate with each other
   at will.
  
<b>Kernel mode vs User mode</b>
- When the CPU is executing kernel code it's running with elevated privileges.
  The software has full control of the hardware and can do "anything" on 
  the system and access all RAM, disk, network resources at will.

- Standard applications will run in user-mode and will have limited access
  to only the RAM memory assigned by the kernel. They will not be able to
  inspect the memory of other processes running on the system. In fact they
  are not aware of such memory due to the many trickeries done by the kernel
  to isolate each task.
  
</pre>

  <span>Process model</span>
<pre xxxsmall zoom>
- Linux follows a parent-child process model.

- Once loaded and initialized during the boot process,
  the kernel will launch an initial user-space process in 
  charge of reading system configuration and (re)start 
  all other user-space processes that builds a running system.

- Normally this initial process is systemd in modern 
  systems (or initd in older or embedded ones).

- Each process can optionally launch new children processes
  up to the resource limits established on the running system.

- By default a child-process inherits the same user (and so, permissions)
  than its parent process. Some processes like the remote
  login "sshd" service (ssh is an acronymn for secure-shell) will
  change the child-process user/permission to a less privileged
  account.

- A simplified process-tree of a running-system will look like:
 
    PROCESS                                       USER    PROCESS   PARENT-ID
                                                         UNIQUE-ID  
    systemd·······································root       1         0
          └─crond·································root      23         1
          |-cupsd·································root      70         1<span orange>
          |-rtkit-daemon··························rtkit    100         1</span>
          |-sshd··································root      10         1<span green>
          |    └─sshd·····························mike     300        10
          |         └─bash························mike     301       300
          |              └─firefox················mike     302       301</span><span brown>
          |-systemd·······························alice    705         1
          |       └─at-spi-bus-laun···············alice    706       705
          |       |···············└─dbus-daemon···alice    707       706
          |       |-gnome-terminal················alice    883       705
          |                       ─bash-+·········alice    884       883
          |                             └─top·····alice    885       884</span>
          |-systemd-journal·······················root      10         1
          ...                                             
    Notice for example that the same process "bash" runs as a user or another
    (<span green>mike</span> or <span brown>alice</span>) depending on the "path"
    followed until the process is executed.
 
    - The initial sshd running as root user, will span a new sshd child process
      with restricted <span green>"mike"</span> privileges/permissions once the user
      has introduced its correct user and password in the remote ssh session, and
      from there on, all children will just be able to run with <span green>"mike"</span>
      privileges/permissions.

    - Similarly the root systemd process will span a new child process will
      restricted <span brown>"alice"</span> privileges/permissions once logged in
      the local console, and from there on, all children will just be able to 
      run with <span brown>"alice"</span> privileges/permissions.

</pre>
  <span>executable file vs in-memory process
<pre xxxsmall zoom>
- Applications are stored on disk drives as files or "bunch-of-instructions and initial data".

- When the kernel executes and application it will read the executable file, load
  the "bunch-of-instructions" into RAM memory, setup the initial data, assign 
  restricted privileges and finally allow the program-in-memory to be executed by
  any free-available CPU on the system.
</pre>
  <span>Basic file permissions:</span>
<pre xxxsmall zoom>
Standar file permissions allows to assign different access permissions to
the owner of the file, the group owner of the file and anyone else.

  <span xsmall>su/sudo: Switch user</span>
<pre xxxsmall zoom>
- su and sudo are mostly used to allow temporal root/superuser access
  to standard users for administrative tasks like installing new applications,
  re-configuring the network, ...

- sudo is ussually considered safer than su. Ubuntu was the first
  distribution to allow sudo-only. Others distributions are also
  changing to sudo-only as time passes.

- sudo offers also a plugable architecture not offered by su
  to provide different authentication and audit mechanisms.

    - buffers are associated with a specific block device, 
      caching filesystem metadata(dir contents, file permissions),
      as tracking in-flight pages (what's being written
      from or read to for a particular block device).

Director Daemon supervises all the backup, restore, verify and archive operations.
Sysadmin uses Director to schedule backups and to recover files..

Console service allows the administrator or user to communicate with the Director
(three versions: text-based, QT-based, wxWidgets)

File Daemon It's installed on the machine to be backed up and is responsible for 
providing the file attributes and data when requested by the Director
as well as for the file system dependent part of restoring the file attributes and data 
during a recovery operation.

Storage daemons are software programs in charge of storage and recovery of the 
file attributes and data to the physical backup media or volumes. In other words, it is 
responsible for reading and writing your tapes (or other storage media, e.g. files)

Catalog Services are responsible for maintaining the file indexes and 
volume databases for all files backed up allowing sysadmin or user to
quickly locate and restore any desired file. The Catalog services sets
Bacula apart from simple backup programs like tar and bru, because the catalog
maintains a record of all Volumes used, all Jobs run, and all Files saved, permitting
efficient restoration and Volume management. Bacula currently supports three different 
databases, MySQL, and PostgreSQL one of which must be chosen when building Bacula.

Monitor Service Allows the administrator or user to watch current status of Directors,
File Daemons and Bacula Storage Daemons. Currently, only a GTK+ version is available.

 Basic Concepts
<pre xxxsmall zoom>
<b>Sandboxes</b>
- each application is built and run in an isolated 'sandbox' environment
  containing an application and its runtime. 
- By default, the application can only access the contents of its sandbox.
- Access to user files, network, graphics sockets, subsystems on the bus and devices
  have to be explicitly granted. 
- Access to other things, such as other processes, is deliberately NOT possible.

-  resources inside the sandbox that need to be exposed outside are known as "exports".
   (Ex: .desktop file and icon,...)

<b>Portals</b>
- Mechanism through which applications can interact with the host environment 
  from within a sandbox. They give the ability to interact with data, files
  and services without the need to add sandbox permissions.

- Examples of capabilities that can be accessed through portals include opening
  files through a file chooser dialog, or printing. 
- Interface toolkits can implement transparent support for portals, so access
  to resources outside of the sandbox will work securely and out of the box.

<b>Repositories</b>
- applications and runtimes are typically stored and published using repositories,
 which behave very similarly to Git repositories, containing a single object or
 multiple ones. Each object is versioned, allowing the up|down-grade. 
- Remote repository's content can be inspected and searched, and it can
  be used as the source of applications and runtimes.
- When an update is performed, new versions of installed applications and 
  runtimes are downloaded from the relevant remotes. (only the difference actually)

AVAILABLE COMMANDS:
<a href="https://dnf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command_ref.html#autoremove-command-label">autoremove</a>
    Removes all "leaf" packages from the system that were originally 
    installed as dependencies of user-installed packages but which are no 
    longer required by any such package.
<a href="https://dnf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command_ref.html#check-command-label">check</a>
    Checks the local packagedb and produces information on any problems it 
    finds. You can pass the check command the options “–dependencies”, “–
    duplicates”, “–obsoleted” or “–provides”, to limit the checking that is 
    performed (the default is “all” which does all).
<a href="https://dnf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command_ref.html#check-update-command-label">check-update</a>
    Non-interactively checks if updates of the specified packages are 
    available. If no <package-specs> are given, checks whether any updates at 
    all are available for your system. DNF exit code will be 100 when there 
    are updates available and a list of the updates will be printed, 0 if not and 1 if an error occurs.

    Please note that having a specific newer version available for an 
    installed package (and reported by check-update) does not imply that 
    subsequent dnf upgrade will install it. The difference is that dnf 
    upgrade must also ensure the satisfiability of all dependencies and other restrictions.

    Output is affected by config option autocheck_running_kernel

<a href="https://dnf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command_ref.html#clean-command-label">clean</a>
    Performs cleanup of temporary files kept for repositories. This includes any 
    such data left behind from disabled or removed repositories as well as 
    for different distribution release 
    versions.
<a href="https://dnf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command_ref.html#distro-sync-command-label">distro-sync</a>
    As necessary upgrades, downgrades or keeps selected installed packages to 
    match the latest version available from any enabled repository. If no 
    package is given, all installed packages are considered.
<a href="https://dnf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command_ref.html#downgrade-command-label">downgrade</a>
    Downgrades the specified packages to the highest installable package of all 
    known lower versions if possible. When version is given and is lower than 
    version of installed package then it downgrades to target version.
<a href="https://dnf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command_ref.html#group-command-label">group</a>
    Groups are virtual collections of packages. DNF keeps track of groups 
    that the user selected (“marked”) installed and can manipulate the 
    comprising packages with simple commands.  (See only manual for more info)
<a href="https://dnf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command_ref.html#help-command-label">help</a>
<a href="https://dnf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command_ref.html#history-command-label">history</a>
   The history command allows the user to view what has happened in past 
    transactions and act according to this information (assuming the history_record configuration option is set).
<a href="https://dnf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command_ref.html#info-command-label">info</a>
     list description and summary information about installed and available packages.
<a href="https://dnf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command_ref.html#install-command-label">install</a>
    DNF makes sure that the given packages and their dependencies are 
    installed on the system. Each <spec> can be either a <package-spec>, or a 
    @<group-spec>. See Install Examples. If a given package or provide cannot 
    be (and is not already) installed, the exit code will be non-zero.

    When <package-spec> that specify exact version of the package is given, 
    DNF will install the desired version, no matter which version of the 
    package is already installed. The former version of the package will be 
    removed in the case of non-installonly package.

    There are also a few specific install commands install-n, install-na and 
    install-nevra that allow the specification of an exact argument in NEVRA 
    format.

    dnf install tito
        Install package tito (tito is package name).
    dnf install ~/Downloads/tito-0.6.2-1.fc22.noarch.rpm
        Install local rpm file tito-0.6.2-1.fc22.noarch.rpm from ~/Downloads/ directory.
    dnf install tito-0.5.6-1.fc22
        Install package with specific version. If the package is already 
        installed it will automatically try to downgrade or upgrade to specific version.
    dnf --best install tito
        Install the latest available version of package. If the package is 
        already installed it will automatically try to upgrade to the latest 
        version. If the latest version of package cannot be installed, the installation fail.
    dnf install vim
        DNF will automatically recognize that vim is not a package name, but 
        provide, and install a package that provides vim with all required 
        dependencies. Note: Package name match has precedence over package provides match.
    dnf install https://kojipkgs.fedoraproject.org//packages/tito/0.6.0/1.fc22/noarch/tito-0.6.0-1.fc22.noarch.rpm
        Install package directly from URL.
    dnf install '@Web Server'
        Install environmental group ‘Web Server’
    dnf install /usr/bin/rpmsign
        Install a package that provides /usr/bin/rpmsign file.
    dnf -y install tito --setopt=install_weak_deps=False
        Install package tito (tito is package name) without weak deps. Weak 
        deps are not required for core functionality of the package, but they 
        enhance the original package (like extended documentation, plugins, 
        additional functions, …). 
<a href="https://dnf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command_ref.html#list-command-label">list</a>
    Dumps lists of packages depending on the packages’ relation to the system
    . A package is installed if it is present in the RPMDB, and it is 
    available if it is not installed but it is present in a repository that 
    DNF knows about. The list command can also limit the displayed packages 
    according to other criteria, e.g. to only those that update an installed 
    package. The exclude option in configuration file (.conf) might influence 
    the result, but if the command line option --disableexcludes is used, it 
    ensure that all installed packages will be listed
<a href="https://dnf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command_ref.html#makecache-command-label">makecache</a>
    dnf [options] makecache
        Downloads and caches in binary format metadata for all known repos. 
        Tries to avoid downloading whenever possible (e.g. when the local 
        metadata hasn’t expired yet or when the metadata timestamp hasn’t changed).
    dnf [options] makecache --timer
        Like plain makecache but instructs DNF to be more resource-aware, 
        meaning will not do anything if running on battery power and will 
        terminate immediately if it’s too soon after the last successful 
        makecache run (see dnf.conf(5), metadata_timer_sync). 
<a href="https://dnf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command_ref.html#mark-command-label">mark</a>
    dnf mark install <package-specs>...
        Marks the specified packages as installed by user. This can be useful 
        if any package was installed as a dependency and is desired to stay on 
        the system when Auto Remove Command or Remove Command along with 
        clean_requirements_on_remove configuration option set to True is executed.
    dnf mark remove <package-specs>...
        Unmarks the specified packages as installed by user....
    dnf mark group <package-specs>...
        Marks the specified packages as installed by group...
<a href="https://dnf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command_ref.html#module-command-label">module</a>
<a href="https://dnf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command_ref.html#provides-command-label">provides</a>
    Finds the packages providing the given <provide-spec>. This is useful 
    when one knows a filename and wants to find what package (installed or not
    ) provides this file.

    Search package metadata for the keywords. Keywords are matched as case-
    insensitive substrings, globbing is supported. By default lists packages 
    that match all requested keys (AND operation). Keys are searched in 
    package names and summaries. If option “–all” is used, lists packages 
    that match at least one of keys (OR operation). And in addition keys are 
    searched in package descriptions and URLs. The result is sorted from the 
    most relevant results to the least.

$ sudo apt-get  install ubuntu-desktop  "package2" ... (-s to simulate)
$ sudo aptitude install ubuntu-desktop  ← Ncurses variant


$ sudo auto-apt run "./configure" ← runs "command_string", installing uninstalled packages when possible.
  ^ keeps databases up-to-date by calling:
    $ auto-apt update
    $ auto-apt updatedb
    $ auto-apt update-local

$ apt-get update ← Run periodically and after modifications to /etc/apt/*

$ apt-get upgrade ← upgrade all installed packages.

$ apt-get dist-upgrade ← same as upgrade, except add the "smart upgrade" checkbox.
                         It tells APT to use "smart" conflict resolution system,
                         and <b>it will attempt to upgrade the most important packages

                         ¡¡¡does not upgrade from a previous version of Ubuntu!!!

<b>Diagnostics:</b>
$ apt-get check    ← update package lists and checks for broken dependencies

<b>Cleaning/Removal</b>
$ sudo apt-get autoclean  ← removes .deb files for packages that are no longer
                            installed on your system. (Can save space in /var/cache/apt/archives)
$ apt-get clean           ← same as autoclean, except it removes all packages from the package cache.
                            Not recomended with slow-connections.

$ sudo apt-get remove "package_name" ← keeps  configuration files 
$ sudo apt-get purge  "package_name" ← Remove configuration files

$ apt-get autoremove     ← removes packages no longer needed

<b>Troubleshooting</b>
$ sudo apt-get -f install  ← Fix Broken Packages (system complains about "unmet dependencies")

$ dpkg-reconfigure "package_name"


$ echo "'package_name' hold" | \  ← Put package_name on hold
  sudo dpkg --set-selections        may have the unintended side effect of preventing upgrades
                                    to packages that depend on updated versions of the pinned package.
                                    apt-get dist-upgrade will override this, but will warn you first.

<b>Search commands</b>
$ apt-cache search "search_term" ← lists packages matching in name or description

$ dpkg -l *"search_term"*  ← find packages whose names contain "search_term".

                                    with the name of the package they came from. 
                                    Its equivalent to the slower (but installed by default):
                                    $ dpkg -S "filename_search_pattern"
$ sudo apt-file update && \       ← Similar to dlocate  but searches over all available packages. 
                                    """what package provides this file?"""

  sudo apt-file search \"filepath_pattern"
<b>Package Info</b>
$ apt-cache show "package_name"  ← shows the description of "package_name", version, size, dependencies and conflicts.
$ dpkg -L "package_name"         ← list files in package
$ dpkg -c foo.deb                ← lists files in the manually downloaded package "./foo.deb".

$ apt-cache pkgnames             ← provides a list of every package in the system

  <a href="https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Alpine_Linux_package_management"><code>apk</code></a> (Alpine/"Docker")
<pre xxxsmall zoom>
Because Alpine Linux is designed to run from RAM, package management involves two phases:

- Installing / Upgrading / Deleting packages on a running system.
- Restoring a system to a previously configured state 
  (e.g. after reboot), including all previously installed packages 
  and locally modified configuration files. (RAM-Based Installs Only)

- apk is the tool used to install, upgrade, or delete software on a running sytem.
- lbu is the tool used to capture the data necessary to 
  restore a system to a previously configured state.

Overview

apk: 
  add      Add new packages to the running system
  del      Delete packages from the running system
  fix      Attempt to repair or upgrade an installed package
  update   Update the index of available packages
  info     Prints information about installed or available packages
  search   Search for packages or descriptions with wildcard patterns
  upgrade  Upgrade the currently installed packages
  cache    Maintenance operations for locally cached package repository
  version  Compare version differences between installed and available packages
  index    create a repository index from a list of packages
  fetch    download (but not install) packages
  audit    List changes to the file system from pristine package install state
  verify   Verify a package signature
  dot      Create a graphviz graph description for a given package
  policy   Display the repository that updates a given 
           package, plus repositories that also offer the package
  stats    Display statistics, including number of 
           packages installed and available, number of 
           directories and files, etc.
  manifest Display checksums for files contained in a given package


- Software packages for Alpine Linux are digitally signed 
  tar.gz archives with ".apk" extension (often called "a-packs")
  stored in one or more repositories (directory with a collection of *.apk files
  and a APKINDEX.tar.gz index )

- The list of repositories to check is stored in /etc/apk/repositories
  (one repo per line)
  Ex:
  /media/sda1/apks
  http://nl.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.7/community
  <b blue>@edge</b> http://nl.alpinelinux.org/alpine/edge/main
  <b blue>@edgecommunity</b> http://nl.alpinelinux.org/alpine/edge/community
  <b blue>@testing</b> http://nl.alpinelinux.org/alpine/edge/testing
  ^ "tagged" repo
    will be used like
    # apk add stableapp newapp@<b blue>edge</b> bleedingapp@<b blue>testing</b>
    by default only untagged repositories are used

Update the Package list
  # apk update (Fill catch locally the latest APKINDEX.tar.gz from remote repos)

Add Packages (transitive dependencies is automatic):
  # apk add openssh openntp vim

Add a packager from dev. repository (dangerous):
  # apk add cherokee --update-cache \
    --repository http://dl-3.alpinelinux.org/alpine/edge/testing/
    --allow-untrusted

Add local Package
  # apk add --allow-untrusted /path/to/file.apk


Remove a Package

  # apk del openssh

Upgrade a Running System

  # apk update
  # apk upgrade

To upgrade only a few packages, use the add command with the -u or --upgrade option:

apk update
apk add --upgrade busybox 
Note: Remember that when you reboot your machine, the remote repository will not be available until after networking is started. This means packages newer than your local boot media will likely not be installed after a reboot. To make an "upgrade" persist over a reboot, use a local cache.
Search for Packages


Search:
 # apk search -v        ← list all packages along with descriptions
 # apk search -v 'acf*' ← list all packages part of the ACF system
 # apk search -v --description 'NTP' ← list all packages that list NTP as 
                                       part of their description,

  Hard/Soft Links
<pre xxxsmall zoom>
In unix an "inode" is the low-level structure that stores the physical location in disk of
a given file. This "inode" is not visible to the user. 
The user visible entities are the file system paths, that point to the real inodes.

When a new file is created we have an structure similar to:

   /my/file/path  (points to)  → inode   (points to) →  physical_block_on_disk
   ^visible in              ^invisible to               ^managed by hard-disk
    user shells,             users, managed              internal circuitry
    GUI explorers,...        by the OS kernel            (or networks NAS)

* We can create <b>symbolic links</b> to a file_path, that are "sortcuts" to access
  a file_path from another file_path like (ln -s):
  
     $ ln -s /my/file/path   /my/newLocation/file/path/symLink
     
      This will leave and structure similar to:
     
        /my/file/path   →  inode   →  physical_block_on_disk
         ↑
         │
        /my/newLocation/file/path/symLink
     
     If the original /my/file/path is deleted or moved the links is broken.
  
  
* A hard-link can also be created pointing direcly to the inode, like (ln):
     $ ln /my/file/path   /my/newLocation/file/path2

      This will leave and structure similar to:
     
        /my/file/path   
                                    →  inode   →  physical_block_on_disk
        /my/newLocation/file/path2

The underlying inode will increase the number of references. The file data can be
accesses independently by the original /my/file/path or the new /my/newLocation/file/path2.
The inode (file) wil exists until all hardlinks or references are deleted.

device mapper: kernel framework mapping virtual block devices to

                                        based on:       
                                        - MAPPED-DEVICE 
                                        - MAPPING-TABLE                

- Data can be also modified in transition, which is performed, for example,
  in the case of device mapper providing disk encryption or simulation of
  unreliable hardware behavior.


<b>Features</b>
- The device mapper "touch" various layers of the Linux kernel's storage stack.

- Functions provided by the device mapper include linear, striped and error mappings,
  as well as crypt and multipath targets.

Exs.:
  - Two disks may be concatenated into one logical volume with a pair
    of linear mappings, one for each disk.

  - crypt target encrypts the data passing through the specified device,
    by using the Linux kernel's Crypto API.

<b>available mapping targets</b>
 - cache    : allows creation of hybrid volumes, by using solid-state drives 
              (SSDs) as caches for hard disk drives (HDDs)
 - crypt    : provides data encryption, by using kernel Crypto API
 - delay    : delays reads and/or writes to different devices (testing)
 - era      : behaves in a way similar to the linear target, while it keeps 
              track of blocks that were written to within a user-defined
              period of time
 - error    : simulates I/O errors for all mapped blocks      (testing)
 - flakey   : simulates periodic unreliable behaviour         (testing)
 - linear   : maps a continuous range of blocks onto another block device
 - mirror   : maps a mirrored logical device, while providing data redundancy
 - multipath: supports the mapping of multipathed devices, through usage of 
              their path groups
 - raid     : offers an interface to Linux kernel's software RAID driver (md)
 - snapshot : (and snapshot-origin) used for creation of LVM snapshots,
              as part of the underlying copy-on-write scheme
 - striped  : stripes the data across physical devices, with the number of
              stripes and the striping chunk size as parameters
 - thin     : allows creation of devices larger than the underlying 
              physical device, physical space is allocated only when
              written to
 - zero     : equivalent of /dev/zero, all reads return blocks of zeros,
              and writes are discarded

<b>kernel features and projects are built on top</b>
Note: user-space apps talk to the device mapper via <b>libdevmapper.so</b>
  which in turn issues ioctls to the /dev/mapper/control device node.

  - cryptsetup    : utility to setup disk encryption based on dm-crypt
  - dm-crypt/LUKS : mapping target providing volume encryption
  - dm-cache      : mapping target providing creation of hybrid volumes
  - dm-integrity  : mapping target providing data integrity, either
                    using checksumming or cryptographic verification,
                    also used with LUKS
  - dm-log-writes : mapping target that uses two devices, passing through
                    the first device and logging the write operations performed
                    to it on the second device
  - dm-verity     : validates the data blocks contained in a file system
                    against a list of cryptographic hash values, developed as 
                    part of the Chromium OS project
  - dmraid(8)     : provides access to "fake" RAID configurations via the 
                    device mapper
  - DM Multipath  : provides I/O failover and load-balancing of block devices
                    within the Linux kernel

                    - allows to configure multiple I/O paths between server nodes 
                      and storage arrays(separate cables|switches|controllers) 
                      into a single mapped/logical device.
                    
                    - Multipathing aggregates the I/O paths, creating a new device
                      that consists of the aggregated paths.


  - Docker        : uses device mapper to create copy-on-write storage for
                    software containers

  - DRBD          : Distributed Replicated Block Device

  - kpartx(8)     : utility called from hotplug upon device maps creation and deletion

  - LVM2          : logical volume manager for the Linux kernel

  - Linux version of TrueCrypt

 <span xsmall>"Full-Journey" SETUP</span>:
<pre xxxsmall zoom>
WARN: You need LVM tools installed. Mount alone is not able to mount LVM volumes

<a href="https://opensource.com/article/18/11/manage-storage-lvm">REF</a>


<b>PRE-SETUP:</b>
Format a <b brown>physical drive /dev/sdx</b> to be included on the pool
# dd if=/dev/zero of=<b orange>/dev/sdx</b> count=8196
# parted /dev/sdx print | grep Disk
Disk /dev/sdx: 100GB
# parted /dev/sdx mklabel gpt
# parted /dev/sdx mkpart primary 1s 100%

Note: Volume-group is synonym of "physical-storage pool"

<b>STEP 1: Create an LVM pool (and add a first physical disk to it)</b>
NOTE: Usually, you don't have to set up LVM at all since most distros 
     defaults to creating a virtual "pool" of storage and adding your
     machine's hard drive(s) to that pool.

# vgcreate volgroup01 /dev/sdx1  # ← create new storage pool and
                                      aggregate disk-partition 


<b>STEP 2: Create logical-volumes</b>
# lvcreate volgroup01 49G --name vol0  # ← create logical-volume /dev/volgroup01/vol0
# lvcreate volgroup01 49G --name vol1  # ← create logical-volume /dev/volgroup01/vol1


<b>STEP 4: Switch volume-group online</b>
# vgchange --activate y volgroup01

<b>STEP 5: make the file systems</b>
# mkfs.ext4 -L finance    /dev/volgroup01/vol0
# mkfs.ext4 -L production /dev/volgroup01/vol1
            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 
            label the drive
            In this case a logical-volume is used by department

<b>STEP 6: Mount the volumes</b>
# mount /dev/volgroup01/vol0 /mnt/vol0
# mount /dev/volgroup01/vol1 /mnt/vol1

<b>STEP 7: Adding space to the volume-group</b>
# part /dev/sdy mkpart primary 1s 100%  # ← create partition on new physical-disk
# vgextend volgroup01 /dev/sdy1         # ← aggregate to volgroup01 
# lvextend -L +49G /dev/volgroup01/vol0 # ← Extend the already-existing logical-volume

PRE-SETUP:
- the LVM toolchain must ready for use in the rescue-mode environment.
   (/usr/sbin directory mounted or similar)

STEPS:
# vgchange --activate y
(output will be similar to)
→ 2 logical volume(s) in volume group "volgroup01" now active
# mkdir /mnt/finance
# mount /dev/volgroup01/finance /mnt/finance
</pre>


  <span xsmall>LVM + LUKS encryption</span>
<pre xxxsmall zoom>
- LUKS stands for Linux-Unified-Key-Setup encryption toolchain.
- LVM  integrates nicely with disk encryption

LUKS encrypts full-partitions (vs files  in GnuPG, ...)

NOTICE/WARN: LUKS will prompts for a password during boot.
             (server-autoboot will fail)


<b>STEP 1: format the partition with the "cryptsetup" command</b>
# cryptsetup luksFormat /dev/sdx1
→ LUKS will warn that it's going to erase your drive: (Accept to continue)
→ A prompt will ask for a passphrase: (Enter it to continue)

The partition is encrypted at this point but no filesystem is in yet:
- In order to partition it you must un-lock it.

# cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sdx1 mySafeDrive # ← Unlock before formating it.
                                ^^^^^^^^^^^ 
                                human-friendly name
                                will create a symlink
                                /dev/mapper/mySafeDrive
                                to auto-generated designator

→ LUKS will ask for the passphrase to un-lock the drive: (Enter it to continue)

- Check the volume is "OK":
# ls -ld /dev/mapper/mySafeDrive
→ lrwxrwxrwx. 1 root root 7 Oct 24 03:58 /dev/mapper/mySafeDrive -> ../dm-4

<b>STEP 2: format with standard-filesystem (ext4,...)</b>
# mkfs.ext4 -o Linux -L mySafeExt4Drive /dev/mapper/mySafeDrive

<b>STEP 3: Mount the unit</b>
# mount /dev/mapper/mySafeExt4Drive /mnt/hd
</pre>

  <span xsmall>Increase LV Size</span>
<pre xxxsmall zoom>
<b>STEP 1: Mark physical disk partition as LVM:</b>
# fdisk -cu /dev/sdd
→ new partition ("n")
  → primary partition ("p")
    → Enter partition number (1-4)
      → Change type ("t") to Linux LVM  ("8e")
        → Check status ("p")
          → Write changes ("c")


<b>STEP 2: create new PV (Physical Volume)</b>
# pvcreate /dev/sdd1
  → Verify the pv:
    # pvs

<b>STEP 3: Extending Volume-Group</b>
# vgextend vg_tecmint /dev/sdd1
  → Verify it:
  # vgs


<b>STEP 4: Increar Logical Volume Size</b>
4.1: Check available free space in volume-group:
# vgdisplay | grep -i "Free"
 → Free  PE / Size       4607 / 18GB  
                         ^^^^^^^^^^^  
                         max size a logical volume

  EXT4
<pre xxxsmall zoom>
Features:
- metadata and journal checksums.
- timestamps intervals down to nanoseconds.
- EXT4 extents: described by its starting and ending place on the hard drive.
  EXT4-Extents make possible to describe very long, physically contiguous files in 
  a single inode pointer entry significantly reducing the number of pointers in large files.
- New anti-fragmentation algorithms.
</pre>

Checks error|fragmentation:

(ussually it must be really low in EXT"N" filesystems):
WARN: Be sure to use the -n flag, preventing fsck to take any action on the file-system

# fsck -fn /dev/sda
→ ...
→ ...
/dev/sda: 613676/3040000 files (<b>0.3% non-contiguous</b>), 6838740/12451840 blocks
</pre>

  Journal
<pre xxxsmall zoom>
- for performance reasons, we do not want to write or sync every change to ext4.
- If the system crashes meanwhile, the changes that are not written to ext4 will
  be lost if Journal is not enabled.
- Every write/sync operation is written to Journal first (not to ext4 first)
  and it is finalized later (written to ext4 later). If the system crashes,
  during recovery, probably on the next boot, Journal is replied back to ext4
  so changes are applied and not lost.

Journal can be used in three different modes (mount option):

  - journal:   All data (both metadata and actual data) is written to Journal first, so the safest.
  - ordered:   This is the default mode. All data is sent to ext4, metadata is sent to Journal also.
               No protection for data but metadata is protected for crash.
  - writeback: Data can be written to ext4 before or after being written to Journal. 
               On a crash, new data may get lost.

The information / blocks is written to Journal following next sequence:

 1.- A Descriptor Block is written, containing the information about the
     final locations of this operation.
 2.- A Data Block is written.(real data or meta data)
 3.- A Commit Block is written. After this, the data can be sent to ext4.
     (Alternatively a Revocation Block will cancel)
     If commit-block is not found, when a replay happens (crash-recovery, ...),
     data will not be written to ext4.
</pre>

 Tunning performance
<pre xxxsmall zoom>
<a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/filesystems/ext4.txt">REF: Kernel.org doc</a>
   Contains full list of mount opts, /proc&amp;/sys entries

Mount options:
journal_async_commit    Commit block can be written to disk without waiting
            for descriptor blocks. If enabled older kernels cannot
            mount the device. This will enable 'journal_checksum'
            internally.


commit=nrsec    (*) Ext4 can be told to sync all its data and metadata
            every 'nrsec' seconds. The default value is 5 seconds.
            This means that if you lose your power, you will lose
            as much as the latest 5 seconds of work (your
            filesystem will not be damaged though, thanks to the
            journaling).  This default value (or any low value)
            will hurt performance, but it's good for data-safety.
            Setting it to 0 will have the same effect as leaving
            it at the default (5 seconds).
            Setting it to very large values will improve
            performance.

inode_readahead_blks=n  This tuning parameter controls the maximum
            number of inode table blocks that ext4's inode
            table readahead algorithm will pre-read into
            the buffer cache.  The default value is 32 blocks.

stripe=n    Number of filesystem blocks that mballoc will try
            to use for allocation size and alignment. For RAID5/6
            systems this should be the number of data
            disks *  RAID chunk size in file system blocks.

min_batch_time=usec This parameter sets the commit time (as
            described above) to be at least min_batch_time.
            It defaults to zero microseconds.  Increasing
            this parameter may improve the throughput of
            multi-threaded, synchronous workloads on very
            fast disks, at the cost of increasing latency.

  - Encryption is automatic, real-time(on-the-fly) and transparent.
  - Parallelization and pipelining allow data to be read
    and written as fast as if the drive was not encrypted.
  - Encryption can be hardware-accelerated on modern processors.
  - Provides plausible deniability, in case an adversary forces

  [ command [ arg ... ] ] |   [ command [ arg ... ] ]


strace runs specified command until it exits intercepting:
  +  system calls called by a process
     - system-call-name + arguments + return-value is printed to STDERR (or -o file)
       Ex output:
       open("/dev/null", O_RDONLY) = 3
       open("/foo/bar", O_RDONLY) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
       
  +  signals    received by a process 
       Ex output:
       $ strace sleep 111
       → ...
       → sigsuspend([] <unfinished ...>
       → --- SIGINT (Interrupt) ---     ← Signal received
       → +++ killed by SIGINT +++

If a system call is being executed and meanwhile another one is being called 
from a different thread/process then strace will try to preserve the order
of those events and mark the ongoing call as being unfinished. 
When the call returns it will be marked as resumed. Ex. output:
  → [pid 28772] select(4, [3], NULL, NULL, NULL &lt;<b>unfinished ...&gt;</b>
  → [pid 28779] clock_gettime(CLOCK_REALTIME, {1130322148, 939977000}) = 0
  → [pid 28772] <b>&lt;... select resumed&gt;</b> )      = 1 (in [3])

Interruption of a (restartable) system call by a signal delivery is
processed differently as kernel terminates the system call and also 
arranges its immediate reexecution after the signal handler completes.

read(0, 0x7ffff72cf5cf, 1)              = ? <b>ERESTARTSYS (To be restarted)</b>

                        must be mounted. All threads belonging to container "name"
                        are monitored when they run on the monitored CPUs. 
                        - Multiple cgroups can be provided. Each cgroup is applied 
                        to the corresponding event, i.e., first cgroup to first event, 
                        - It is possible to provide an empty cgroup 
                          (monitor all the time) using, e.g., -G foo,,bar.
                        - Cgroups must have corresponding events, i.e., they always
                          refer to events defined earlier on the command line.

setup
<b>Ubuntu Setup:</b>
  STEP 1: Edit /etc/default/grub and add "zswap.enabled=1" option to "GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT".
    For example, a line like
    | GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash" 
    becomes 
    | GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash zswap.enabled=1".
  
  STEP 2: Update Grub configuration:
  $ sudo update-grub
  
  STEP 3: Reboot and the zswap module will be enabled automatically.
  
  STEP 4: After you reboot, check if the module is active:
  $ cat /sys/module/zswap/parameters/enabled

<b>Fedora&amp;OpenSUSE Setup:</b>
STEP 1: Edit /etc/default/grub and add "zswap.enabled=1" option to GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX

STEP 2: Update Grub configuration:
$ sudo grub2-mkconfig -o $(sudo find /boot/ -name grub.cfg)
                           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 
                          Depending on whether your computer
                          boots from a BIOS or UEFI system 
                          the path will change

STEP 3: Reboot and the zswap module will be enabled automatically.

STEP 4: After you reboot, check if the module is active:
$ cat /sys/module/zswap/parameters/enabled
(must display "Y,")

<b>Tunning</b>
-  Check adding the (grub) option "zswap.max_pool_percent=20" to see if performance increase.
   It’s recommended NOT to go above 50% since more than that can have detrimental effects 
   on systems with low amounts of RAM.
