  <b>Filesystem Basics</b>
  Moving around FS
<pre xxxsmall zoom>
<b>Display current working directory</b>
$ pwd  # pwd: "P"rint "W"orking "D"irectory
<b>Change to directory</b>
$ cd /home/myUser/Dowload

<b>(ls "file or directory") List "file" or "files in directory"</b>
With no file or directory list info in current working directory
ls -l :  ("long"), show permissions, file size, modification date, ownership
ls -a :  ("all" ), shows also hidden files (files/dirs starting with ".") 
ls -d :  Show only directory entry, do NOT display directory contents 
ls -F :  ("format") append helper graphical symbol like '*' for executable files
ls -S :  sort by size output in descending order
ls -R :  ("recursive") list recursively children directories

</pre>

  handling files/dirs
<pre xxxsmall zoom>
<b>Create directory</b>
mkdir -p /home/myUser/work/project01 # -p: will create any non-existing directory up to project01
                                     #     Withouth -p mkdir will fail if /home/myUser/work does not exists

<b>Moving files</b>
$ mv /my/path01/myFile1  /my/path02/   # move myFile1 from path01 to path02 directory
<b>Rename file</b>
$ mv myOriginalName  myFinalName   # use the mv (move) command to rename
<b>copying files</b>
$ cp    /tmp/fileToCopy       /home/myUser/ # copy to destination directory
$ cp -R /tmp/directoryToCopy  /home/myUser/ # copy recursively (-R) directory to destination directory


<b>Remove files/directories</b>
$ rm -f file       # force (-f) file deletion.  The -f option is useful for automated scripts
$ rm -rf directory # force (-f) directory deletion recursively (-r). Do not ask before deleting
                   # Be very careful with recursive deletions. Specially as root user

<b>Securely remove files by overwriting first</b>
$ shred -n 2 -z -v /tmp/myImportantSecret  # -n 2: Overwrite twice with random data
                                           # finally write over with zeroes (-z)

  Hard/Soft Links
<pre xxxsmall zoom>
In unix an "inode" is the low-level structure that stores the physical location in disk of
a given file. This "inode" is not visible to the user. 
The user visible entities are the file system paths, that point to the real inodes.

When a new file is created we have an structure similar to:

   /my/file/path  (points to)  → inode   (points to) →  physical_block_on_disk
   ^visible in              ^invisible to               ^managed by hard-disk
    user shells,             users, managed              internal circuitry
    GUI explorers,...        by the OS kernel            (or networks NAS)

* We can create <b>symbolic links</b> to a file_path, that are "sortcuts" to access
  a file_path from another file_path like (ln -s):
  
     $ ln -s /my/file/path   /my/newLocation/file/path/symLink
     
      This will leave and structure similar to:
     
        /my/file/path   →  inode   →  physical_block_on_disk
         ↑
         │
        /my/newLocation/file/path/symLink
     
     If the original /my/file/path is deleted or moved the links is broken.
  
  
* A hard-link can also be created pointing direcly to the inode, like (ln):
     $ ln /my/file/path   /my/newLocation/file/path2

      This will leave and structure similar to:
     
        /my/file/path   
                                    →  inode   →  physical_block_on_disk
        /my/newLocation/file/path2

The underlying inode will increase the number of references. The file data can be
accesses independently by the original /my/file/path or the new /my/newLocation/file/path2.
The inode (file) wil exists until all hardlinks or references are deleted.

The "stat" command can be used to inspect inodes and other advanced info for a given
file path.

  Searching files/data
<pre xxxsmall zoom>
<b><a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/find">find</a> files whose name ends in "html"</b>
Ex 1: "complex" find 
Command             |   Human explanation
(split into lines   |
 for readability)   |
------------------- +--------------------
$ find              |   let's display find results
   /var/lib         | ←     starting in this base directory and subdirectories
   -type f          | ← AND of type file (ignore directories, links, ...)
   -iname "*html"   | ← AND whose name matches *html (iname:ignore case, name: case sensitive)
   -mmin  -30       | ← AND whose modification time is 30 or less (-30) minutes (-mmin)
   -msize +20k      | ← AND whose size (msize) is 20kilobytes or more (+20)

Director Daemon supervises all the backup, restore, verify and archive operations.
Sysadmin uses Director to schedule backups and to recover files..

Console service allows the administrator or user to communicate with the Director
(three versions: text-based, QT-based, wxWidgets)

File Daemon It's installed on the machine to be backed up and is responsible for 
providing the file attributes and data when requested by the Director
as well as for the file system dependent part of restoring the file attributes and data 
during a recovery operation.

Storage daemons are software programs in charge of storage and recovery of the 
file attributes and data to the physical backup media or volumes. In other words, it is 
responsible for reading and writing your tapes (or other storage media, e.g. files)

Catalog Services are responsible for maintaining the file indexes and 
volume databases for all files backed up allowing sysadmin or user to
quickly locate and restore any desired file. The Catalog services sets
Bacula apart from simple backup programs like tar and bru, because the catalog
maintains a record of all Volumes used, all Jobs run, and all Files saved, permitting
efficient restoration and Volume management. Bacula currently supports three different 
databases, MySQL, and PostgreSQL one of which must be chosen when building Bacula.

Monitor Service Allows the administrator or user to watch current status of Directors,
File Daemons and Bacula Storage Daemons. Currently, only a GTK+ version is available.

   Text modification tools
<pre xxxsmall zoom>
By default we can use next tools like:
   $ tool inputFile   # Apply to given file
or
   $ command1 ... | tool1 | tool2 | tool3 # Use stdout from previous command (|) as input 

sorting content:
$ sort file1  ← Sorting alphabetically lines in file  (-r to reverse, -g for numerical sort)
j
$ sort file1 -t ':' -k 4 -k 1    ← Use ':' as separator, sort first by column 4, then column 1.

$ join file1 file2    ← Join two lines together assuming they share at least one common value
                        on the relevant line, skiping lines withouth common value.

Cut by column:
$ cut -d "," -f 1,3,7 file1.csv ← Use "," as column delimiter, show then columns 1,3,7
$ cut -c 1-50         file.txt  ← show characters 1 to 50 in each line
$ cut -5, 8, 20-      file.txt  ← show characters 1 to 5 and 8 and from 20 to the end

        This would display (“cut”) characters (columns) 1 to 5, 8 and from 20 to the end.

$ uniq file1     ←  Eliminates duplicate entries from a file
                    Commonly used with sort like:
                    $ cat file.txt | sort | uniq
                    Options: -c: display number of occurances of each duplicate
                             -u: list only unique entries
                             -d: list only duplicate entries

$ tr "u" "d" file1  ← translate all instances of characters in a text file
$  cat some_file | tr '[A-Z]' '[a-z]' > new_file  ← Convert all capital letters to lowercase

$ nl file1.txt  ← Display file1.txt to STDOUT prefixing with line numbers

$ sed "s/<b green>up</b>/<b orange>down</b>/<b blue>g</b>" file1.txt ← Replaces "<b green>up</b>" by "<b orange>down</b>". "<b blue>g</b>" flags indicates to replace all ocurrences. Otherwise only first is replaced.
sed stays for "Stream editor", and has a lot of powerful flags like searching for regular expresions ...

AVAILABLE COMMANDS:
<a href="https://dnf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command_ref.html#autoremove-command-label">autoremove</a>
    Removes all "leaf" packages from the system that were originally 
    installed as dependencies of user-installed packages but which are no 
    longer required by any such package.
<a href="https://dnf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command_ref.html#check-command-label">check</a>
    Checks the local packagedb and produces information on any problems it 
    finds. You can pass the check command the options “–dependencies”, “–
    duplicates”, “–obsoleted” or “–provides”, to limit the checking that is 
    performed (the default is “all” which does all).
<a href="https://dnf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command_ref.html#check-update-command-label">check-update</a>
    Non-interactively checks if updates of the specified packages are 
    available. If no <package-specs> are given, checks whether any updates at 
    all are available for your system. DNF exit code will be 100 when there 
    are updates available and a list of the updates will be printed, 0 if not and 1 if an error occurs.

    Please note that having a specific newer version available for an 
    installed package (and reported by check-update) does not imply that 
    subsequent dnf upgrade will install it. The difference is that dnf 
    upgrade must also ensure the satisfiability of all dependencies and other restrictions.

    Output is affected by config option autocheck_running_kernel

<a href="https://dnf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command_ref.html#clean-command-label">clean</a>
    Performs cleanup of temporary files kept for repositories. This includes any 
    such data left behind from disabled or removed repositories as well as 
    for different distribution release 
    versions.
<a href="https://dnf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command_ref.html#distro-sync-command-label">distro-sync</a>
    As necessary upgrades, downgrades or keeps selected installed packages to 
    match the latest version available from any enabled repository. If no 
    package is given, all installed packages are considered.
<a href="https://dnf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command_ref.html#downgrade-command-label">downgrade</a>
    Downgrades the specified packages to the highest installable package of all 
    known lower versions if possible. When version is given and is lower than 
    version of installed package then it downgrades to target version.
<a href="https://dnf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command_ref.html#group-command-label">group</a>
    Groups are virtual collections of packages. DNF keeps track of groups 
    that the user selected (“marked”) installed and can manipulate the 
    comprising packages with simple commands.  (See only manual for more info)
<a href="https://dnf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command_ref.html#help-command-label">help</a>
<a href="https://dnf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command_ref.html#history-command-label">history</a>
   The history command allows the user to view what has happened in past 
    transactions and act according to this information (assuming the history_record configuration option is set).
<a href="https://dnf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command_ref.html#info-command-label">info</a>
     list description and summary information about installed and available packages.
<a href="https://dnf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command_ref.html#install-command-label">install</a>
    DNF makes sure that the given packages and their dependencies are 
    installed on the system. Each <spec> can be either a <package-spec>, or a 
    @<group-spec>. See Install Examples. If a given package or provide cannot 
    be (and is not already) installed, the exit code will be non-zero.

    When <package-spec> that specify exact version of the package is given, 
    DNF will install the desired version, no matter which version of the 
    package is already installed. The former version of the package will be 
    removed in the case of non-installonly package.

    There are also a few specific install commands install-n, install-na and 
    install-nevra that allow the specification of an exact argument in NEVRA 
    format.

    dnf install tito
        Install package tito (tito is package name).
    dnf install ~/Downloads/tito-0.6.2-1.fc22.noarch.rpm
        Install local rpm file tito-0.6.2-1.fc22.noarch.rpm from ~/Downloads/ directory.
    dnf install tito-0.5.6-1.fc22
        Install package with specific version. If the package is already 
        installed it will automatically try to downgrade or upgrade to specific version.
    dnf --best install tito
        Install the latest available version of package. If the package is 
        already installed it will automatically try to upgrade to the latest 
        version. If the latest version of package cannot be installed, the installation fail.
    dnf install vim
        DNF will automatically recognize that vim is not a package name, but 
        provide, and install a package that provides vim with all required 
        dependencies. Note: Package name match has precedence over package provides match.
    dnf install https://kojipkgs.fedoraproject.org//packages/tito/0.6.0/1.fc22/noarch/tito-0.6.0-1.fc22.noarch.rpm
        Install package directly from URL.
    dnf install '@Web Server'
        Install environmental group ‘Web Server’
    dnf install /usr/bin/rpmsign
        Install a package that provides /usr/bin/rpmsign file.
    dnf -y install tito --setopt=install_weak_deps=False
        Install package tito (tito is package name) without weak deps. Weak 
        deps are not required for core functionality of the package, but they 
        enhance the original package (like extended documentation, plugins, 
        additional functions, …). 
<a href="https://dnf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command_ref.html#list-command-label">list</a>
    Dumps lists of packages depending on the packages’ relation to the system
    . A package is installed if it is present in the RPMDB, and it is 
    available if it is not installed but it is present in a repository that 
    DNF knows about. The list command can also limit the displayed packages 
    according to other criteria, e.g. to only those that update an installed 
    package. The exclude option in configuration file (.conf) might influence 
    the result, but if the command line option --disableexcludes is used, it 
    ensure that all installed packages will be listed
<a href="https://dnf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command_ref.html#makecache-command-label">makecache</a>
    dnf [options] makecache
        Downloads and caches in binary format metadata for all known repos. 
        Tries to avoid downloading whenever possible (e.g. when the local 
        metadata hasn’t expired yet or when the metadata timestamp hasn’t changed).
    dnf [options] makecache --timer
        Like plain makecache but instructs DNF to be more resource-aware, 
        meaning will not do anything if running on battery power and will 
        terminate immediately if it’s too soon after the last successful 
        makecache run (see dnf.conf(5), metadata_timer_sync). 
<a href="https://dnf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command_ref.html#mark-command-label">mark</a>
    dnf mark install <package-specs>...
        Marks the specified packages as installed by user. This can be useful 
        if any package was installed as a dependency and is desired to stay on 
        the system when Auto Remove Command or Remove Command along with 
        clean_requirements_on_remove configuration option set to True is executed.
    dnf mark remove <package-specs>...
        Unmarks the specified packages as installed by user....
    dnf mark group <package-specs>...
        Marks the specified packages as installed by group...
<a href="https://dnf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command_ref.html#module-command-label">module</a>
<a href="https://dnf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command_ref.html#provides-command-label">provides</a>
    Finds the packages providing the given <provide-spec>. This is useful 
    when one knows a filename and wants to find what package (installed or not
    ) provides this file.

    dnf [options] repoquery [<select-options>] [<query-options>] [<pkg-spec>]
        Searches the available DNF repositories for selected packages and 
        displays the requested information about them. It is an equivalent of rpm 
        -q for remote repositories.
    dnf [options] repoquery --querytags
        Provides list of recognized tags by repoquery option --queryformat
        There are also a few specific repoquery commands repoquery-n, 
        repoquery-na and repoquery-nevra that allow the specification of an exact 
        argument in NEVRA format (does not affect arguments of options like –
        whatprovides <arg>, …).

<a href="https://dnf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command_ref.html#search-command-label">search</a>
    Search package metadata for the keywords. Keywords are matched as case-
    insensitive substrings, globbing is supported. By default lists packages 
    that match all requested keys (AND operation). Keys are searched in 
    package names and summaries. If option “–all” is used, lists packages 
    that match at least one of keys (OR operation). And in addition keys are 
    searched in package descriptions and URLs. The result is sorted from the 
    most relevant results to the least.

<a href="https://dnf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command_ref.html#swap-command-label">swap</a>
    Remove spec and install spec in one transaction. Each "spec" can be 
    either a <package-spec>, which specifies a package directly, or a 
    @"group-spec", which specifies an (environment) group which contains it. 
    Automatic conflict solving is provided in DNF by –allowerasing option 
    that provides functionality of swap command automatically
<a href="https://dnf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command_ref.html#updateinfo-command-label">updateinfo</a>
    Display information about update advisories.
    Depending on output type, DNF displays just counts of advisory types (
    omitted or --summary), list of advisories (--list) or detailed 
    information (--info). When --info with -v option is used, the information 
    is even more detailed

<pre xxxsmall zoom>

  <a TODO href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SourcesList">Package source list: /etc/apt/sources.list file</a>


$ sudo apt-get  install ubuntu-desktop  "package2" ... (-s to simulate)
$ sudo aptitude install ubuntu-desktop  ← Ncurses variant


$ sudo auto-apt run "./configure" ← runs "command_string", installing uninstalled packages when possible.
  ^ keeps databases up-to-date by calling:
    $ auto-apt update
    $ auto-apt updatedb
    $ auto-apt update-local

$ apt-get update ← Run periodically and after modifications to /etc/apt/*

$ apt-get upgrade ← upgrade all installed packages.

$ apt-get dist-upgrade ← same as upgrade, except add the "smart upgrade" checkbox.
                         It tells APT to use "smart" conflict resolution system,
                         and <b>it will attempt to upgrade the most important packages 
                         at the expense of less important ones if necessary.</b>
                         ¡¡¡does not upgrade from a previous version of Ubuntu!!!

<b>Diagnostics:</b>
$ apt-get check    ← update package lists and checks for broken dependencies

<b>Cleaning/Removal</b>
$ sudo apt-get autoclean  ← removes .deb files for packages that are no longer
                            installed on your system. (Can save space in /var/cache/apt/archives)
$ apt-get clean           ← same as autoclean, except it removes all packages from the package cache.
                            Not recomended with slow-connections.
                            ($ du -sh /var/cache/apt/archives)

$ sudo apt-get remove "package_name" ← keeps  configuration files 
$ sudo apt-get purge  "package_name" ← Remove configuration files

$ apt-get autoremove     ← removes packages no longer needed

<b>Troubleshooting</b>
$ sudo apt-get -f install  ← Fix Broken Packages (system complains about "unmet dependencies")

$ dpkg-reconfigure "package_name"


$ echo "'package_name' hold" | \  ← Put package_name on hold
  sudo dpkg --set-selections        may have the unintended side effect of preventing upgrades
                                    to packages that depend on updated versions of the pinned package.
                                    apt-get dist-upgrade will override this, but will warn you first.

<b>Search commands</b>
$ apt-cache search "search_term" ← lists packages matching in name or description

$ dpkg -l *"search_term"*  ← find packages whose names contain "search_term".
                             It also shows whether a package is installed on your system

$ dlocate "package_name"         ← "reverse lookup". It Determines which installed package owns "package_name".
                                    It shows files from installed packages that match "package_name",
                                    with the name of the package they came from. 
                                    Its equivalent to the slower (but installed by default):
                                    $ dpkg -S "filename_search_pattern"
$ sudo apt-file update && \       ← Similar to dlocate  but searches over all available packages. 
                                    """what package provides this file?"""

  sudo apt-file search \"filepath_pattern"
<b>Package Info</b>
$ apt-cache show "package_name"  ← shows the description of "package_name", version, size, dependencies and conflicts.
$ dpkg -L "package_name"         ← list files in package
$ dpkg -c foo.deb                ← lists files in the manually downloaded package "./foo.deb".

$ apt-cache pkgnames             ← provides a list of every package in the system



<b>Setting http-proxy</b>
- alt 1: Temporary proxy session:
  # export http_proxy=http://username:password@yourproxyaddress:proxyport

- alt 2: APT configuration file method 
  Add next line to /etc/apt/apt.conf 
  | Acquire::http::Proxy "http://yourproxyaddress:proxyport";

        <b>SELinux Policy Behavior</b>
        When an SELinux-enabled system starts, the policy is loaded into memory organized in modules.
        <code><b>se</b>module</code> can be used for a number other tasks like installing,
        removing, reloading, upgrading, enabling and disabling SELinux policy modules.
        
<pre>
#~ <b>se</b>module -l # lists modules currently loaded
(output will be similar to ...)
abrt    1.2.0
accountsd       1.0.6
acct    1.5.1
afs     1.8.2
...
</pre>
        <br/>
        Although you can't read the (binary) policy module files, there's a simple way to tweak their settings.
<pre>
#~ <b>se</b>manage boolean -l

What happens to a container's MCS label when the container is rebuilt or upgraded?

____________________________________________
SELinux users access fine-tune:


You do not create an SELinux user with a command, 
nor does it have its own login access to the server.

SELinux users are defined in the policy loaded into memory at boot time
, and there are only a few of these users. 

To view this Linux/SELinux user mapping:

#~ <b>se</b>manage login -l

In CentOS 7, this is what we may see:

Login Name           SELinux User         MLS/MCS Range        Service

__default__          unconfined_u         s0-s0:c0.c1023       *
root                 unconfined_u         s0-s0:c0.c1023       *
system_u             system_u             s0-s0:c0.c1023       *

The first column in this table, "Login Name", represents the local Linux user accounts. But there are only three listed here, you may ask, didn't we create a few accounts in the second part of this tutorial? Yes, and they are represented by the entry shown as default. Any regular Linux user account is first mapped to the default login. This is then mapped to the SELinux user called unconfined_u. In our case, this is the second column of the first row. The third column shows the multilevel security / Multi Category Security (MLS / MCS) class for the user. For now, let's ignore that part and also the column after that (Service).

Next, we have the root user. Note that it's not mapped to the "default" login, rather it has been given its own entry. Once again, root is also mapped to the unconfined_u SELinux user.

system_u is a different class of user, meant for running processes or daemons.

To see what SELinux users are available in the system, we can run the semanage user command:

semanage user -l

The output in our CentOS 7 system should look like this:

                 Labeling   MLS/       MLS/
SELinux User    Prefix     MCS Level  MCS Range        SELinux Roles

guest_u         user       s0         s0               guest_r
root            user       s0         s0-s0:c0.c1023   staff_r sysadm_r system_r unconfined_r
staff_u         user       s0         s0-s0:c0.c1023   staff_r sysadm_r system_r unconfined_r
sysadm_u        user       s0         s0-s0:c0.c1023   sysadm_r
system_u        user       s0         s0-s0:c0.c1023   system_r unconfined_r
unconfined_u    user       s0         s0-s0:c0.c1023   system_r unconfined_r
user_u          user       s0         s0               user_r
xguest_u        user       s0         s0               xguest_r

What does this bigger table mean? First of all, it shows the different SELinux users defined by the policy. We had seen users like unconfined_u and system_u before, but we are now seeing other types of users like guest_u, staff_u, sysadm_u, user_u and so on. The names are somewhat indicative of the rights associated with them. For example, we can perhaps assume that the sysadm_u user would have more access rights than guest_u.

To verify our guest, let's look at the fifth column, SELinux Roles. If you remember from the first part of this tutorial, SELinux roles are like gateways between a user and a process. We also compared them to filters: a user may enter a role, provided the role grants it. If a role is authorized to access a process domain, the users associated with that role will be able to enter that process domain.

Now from this table we can see the unconfined_u user is mapped to the system_r and unconfined_r roles. Although not evident here, SELinux policy actually allows these roles to run processes in the unconfined_t domain. Similarly, user sysadm_u is authorized for the sysadmr role, but guestu is mapped to guest_r role. Each of these roles will have different domains authorized for them.

Now if we take a step back, we also saw from the first code snippet that the default login maps to the unconfinedu user, just like the root user maps to the unconfined_u user. Since the **default_** login represents any regular Linux user account, those accounts will be authorized for system_r and unconfined_r roles as well.

So what this really means is that any Linux user that maps to the unconfined_u user will have the privileges to run any app that runs within the unconfined_t domain.

To demonstrate this, let's run the id -Z command as the root user:

id -Z

This shows the SELinux security context for root:

unconfined_u:unconfined_r:unconfined_t:s0-s0:c0.c1023

So the root account is mapped to the unconfined_u SELinux user, and unconfined_u is authorized for the unconfined_r role, which in turn is authorized to run processes in the unconfined_t domain.

We suggest that you take the time now to start four new SSH sessions with the four users you created from separate terminal windows. This will help us switch between different accounts when needed.

    regularuser
    switcheduser
    guestuser
    restricteduser

Next, we switch to the terminal session logged in as the regularuser. If you remember, we created a number of user accounts in the second tutorial, and regularuser was one of them. If you have not already done so, open a separate terminal window to connect to your CentOS 7 system as regularuser. If we execute the same id -Z command from there, the output will look like this:

[regularuser@localhost ~]$ id -Z

unconfined_u:unconfined_r:unconfined_t:s0-s0:c0.c1023

In this case, regulauser account is mapped to the unconfined_u SELinux user account and it can assume the unconfined_r role. The role can run processes in an unconfined domain. This is the same SELinux user/role/domain the root account also maps to. That's because SELinux targeted policy allows logged in users to run in unconfined domains.

We had seen the list of a number of SELinux users before:

    guest_u: This user doesn't have access to X-Window system (GUI) or networking and can't execute su / sudo command.
    xguest_u: This user has access to GUI tools and networking is available via Firefox browser.
    user_u: This user has more access than the guest accounts (GUI and networking), but can't switch users by running su or sudo.
    staff_u: Same rights as user_u, except it can execute sudo command to have root privileges.
    system_u: This user is meant for running system services and not to be mapped to regular user accounts.

SELinux in Action 1: Restricting Switched User Access

To see how SELinux can enforce security for user accounts, let's think about the regularuser account. As a system administrator, you now know the user has the same unrestricted SELinux privileges as the root account and you would like to change that. Specifically, you don't want the user to be able to switch to other accounts, including the root account.

Let's first check the user's ability to switch to another account. In the following code snippet, the regularuser switches to the switcheduser account. We assume he knows the password for switcheduser:

[regularuser@localhost ~]$ su - switcheduser
Password:
[switcheduser@localhost ~]$

Next, we go back to the terminal window logged in as the root user and change regularuser's SELinux user mapping. We will map regularuser to user_u.

semanage login -a -s user_u regularuser

So what are we doing here? We are adding (-a) the regularuser account to the SELinux (-s) user account user_u. The change won't take effect until regularuser logs out and logs back in.

Going back to regularuser's terminal window, we first switch back from switcheduser:

[switcheduser@localhost ~]$ logout

Next the regularuser also logs out:

[regularuser@localhost ~]$ logout

We then open a new terminal window to connect as regularuser. Next, we try to change to switcheduser again:

[regularuser@localhost ~]$ su - switcheduser

Password:

This is what we see now:

su: Authentication failure

If we now run the id -Z command again to see the SELinux context for regularuser, we will see the output is quite different from what we saw before: regularuser is now mapped to user_u.

[regularuser@localhost ~]$ id -Z

user_u:user_r:user_t:s0

So where would you use such restrictions? You can think of an application development team within your IT organization. You may have a number of developers and testers in that team coding and testing the latest app for your company. As a system administrator you know developers are switching from their account to some of the high-privileged accounts to make ad-hoc changes to your server. You can stop this from happening by restricting their ability to switch accounts. (Mind you though, it still doesn't stop them from logging in directly as the high-privileged user).
SELinux in Action 2: Restricting Permissions to Run Scripts

Let's see another example of restricting user access through SELinux. Run these commands from the root session.

By default, SELinux allows users mapped to the guest_t account to execute scripts from their home directories. We can run the getsebool command to check the boolean value:

getsebool allow_guest_exec_content

The output shows the flag is on.

guest_exec_content - -> on

To verify its effect, let's first change the SELinux user mapping for the guestuser account we created at the beginning of this tutorial. We will do it as the root user.

semanage login -a -s guest_u guestuser

We can verify the action by running the semanage login -l command again:

semanage login -l

As we can see, guestuser is now mapped to the guest_u SELinux user account.

Login Name           SELinux User         MLS/MCS Range        Service

__default__          unconfined_u         s0-s0:c0.c1023       *
guestuser            guest_u              s0                   *
regularuser          user_u               s0                   *
root                 unconfined_u         s0-s0:c0.c1023       *
system_u             system_u             s0-s0:c0.c1023       *

If we have a terminal window open as guestuser, we will log out from it and log back in a new terminal window as guestuser.

Next we will create an extremely simple bash script in the user's home directory. The following code blocks first checks the home directory, then creates the file and reads it on console. Finally the execute permission is changed.

Verify that you are in the guestuser home directory:

[guestuser@localhost ~]$ pwd

/home/guestuser

Create the script:

[guestuser@localhost ~]$ vi myscript.sh

Script contents:

#!/bin/bash
echo "This is a test script"

Make the script executable:

chmod u+x myscript.sh

When we try to execute the script as guestuser, it works as expected:

[guestuser@localhost ~]$ ~/myscript.sh

This is a test script

Next we go back to the root terminal window and change the boolean setting allow_guest_exec_content to off and verify it:

setsebool allow_guest_exec_content off
getsebool allow_guest_exec_content

guest\_exec\_content - -> off

Going back to the console logged in as guestuser we try to run the script again. This time, the access is denied:

[guestuser@localhost ~]$ ~/myscript.sh

-bash: /home/guestuser/myscript.sh: Permission denied

So this is how SELinux can apply an additional layer of security on top of DAC. Even when the user has full read, write, execute access to the script created in their own home directory, they can still be stopped from executing it. Where would you need it? Well, think about a production system. You know developers have access to it as do some of the contractors working for your company. You would like them to access the server for viewing error messages and log files, but you don't want them to execute any shell scripts. To do this, you can first enable SELinux and then ensure the corresponding boolean value is set.

We will talk about SELinux error messages shortly, but for now, if we are eager to see where this denial was logged we can look at the /var/log/messages file. Execute this from the root session:

grep "SELinux is preventing" /var/log/messages

The last two messages in the file in our CentOS 7 server show the access denial:

Aug 23 12:59:42 localhost setroubleshoot: SELinux is preventing /usr/bin/bash from execute access on the file . For complete SELinux messages. run sealert -l 8343a9d2-ca9d-49db-9281-3bb03a76b71a
Aug 23 12:59:42 localhost python: SELinux is preventing /usr/bin/bash from execute access on the file .

The message also shows a long ID value and suggests we run the sealert command with this ID for more information. The following command shows this (use your own alert ID):

sealert -l 8343a9d2-ca9d-49db-9281-3bb03a76b71a

And indeed, the output shows us greater detail about the error:

SELinux is preventing /usr/bin/bash from execute access on the file .

*****  Plugin catchall_boolean (89.3 confidence) suggests   ******************

If you want to allow guest to exec content
Then you must tell SELinux about this by enabling the 'guest\_exec\_content' boolean.
You can read 'None' man page for more details.
Do
setsebool -P guest\_exec\_content 1

*****  Plugin catchall (11.6 confidence) suggests   **************************

...

It's a large amount of output, but note the few lines at the beginning:

SELinux is preventing /usr/bin/bash from execute access on the file .

That gives us a pretty good idea where the error is coming from.

The next few lines also tell you how to fix the error:

If you want to allow guest to exec content
Then you must tell SELinux about this by enabling the 'guest\_exec\_content' boolean.
...
setsebool -P guest\_exec\_content 1

SELinux in Action 3: Restricting Access to Services

In the first part of this series we talked about SELinux roles when we introduced the basic terminology of users, roles, domains, and types. Let's now see how roles also play a part in restricting user access. As we said before, a role in SELinux sits between the user and the process domain and controls what domains the user's process can get into. Roles are not that important when we see them in file security contexts. For files, it's listed with a generic value of object_r. Roles become important when dealing with users and processes.

Let's first make sure that the httpd daemon is not running in the system. As the root user, you can run the following command to make sure the process is stopped:

service httpd stop

Next, we switch to the terminal window we had logged in as restricteduser and try to see the SELinux security context for it. If you don't have the terminal window open, start a new terminal session against the system and log in as the restricteduser account we had created at the beginning of this tutorial.

[restricteduser@localhost ~]$ id -Z
unconfined_u:unconfined_r:unconfined_t:s0-s0:c0.c1023

So the account has the default behaviour of running as unconfined_u user and having access to unconfined_r role. However, this account does not have the right to start any processes within the system. The following code block shows that restricteduser is trying to start the httpd daemon and getting an access denied error:

[restricteduser@localhost ~]$ service httpd start
Redirecting to /bin/systemctl start  httpd.service
Failed to issue method call: Access denied

Next we move back to the root user terminal window and make sure the restricteduser account has been added to the /etc/sudoers file. This action will enable the restricteduser account to use root privileges.

visudo

And then in the file, add the following line, save and exit:

restricteduser ALL=(ALL)      ALL

If we now log out of the restricteduser terminal window and log back in again, we can start and stop the httpd service with sudo privileges:

[restricteduser@localhost ~]$ sudo service httpd start


We trust you have received the usual lecture from the local System
Administrator. It usually boils down to these three things:

    #1) Respect the privacy of others.
    #2) Think before you type.
    #3) With great power comes great responsibility.

[sudo] password for restricteduser:
Redirecting to /bin/systemctl start  httpd.service

The user can also stop the service now:

[restricteduser@localhost ~]$ sudo service httpd stop

Redirecting to /bin/systemctl stop  httpd.service

That's all very normal: system administrators give sudo access to user accounts they trust. But what if you want to stop this particular user from starting the httpd service even when the user's account is listed in the sudoers file?

To see how this can be achieved, let's switch back to the root user's terminal window and map the restricteduser to the SELinux user_r account. This is what we did for the regularuser account in another example.

semanage login -a -s user_u restricteduser

Going back to restricteduser's terminal window, we log out and log back in again in a new terminal session as restricteduser.

Now that restricteduser has been restricted to user_u (and that means to role user_r and domain user_t), we can verify its access using the seinfo command from our root user's window:

seinfo -uuser_u -x

The output shows the roles user_u can assume. These are object_r and user_r:

   user_u
      default level: s0
      range: s0
      roles:
         object_r
         user_r

Taking it one step further, we can run the seinfo command to check what domains the user_r role is authorized to enter:

seinfo -ruser_r -x

There are a number of domains user_r is authorized to enter:

   user_r
      Dominated Roles:
         user_r
      Types:
         git_session_t
         sandbox_x_client_t
         git_user_content_t
         virt_content_t
         policykit_grant_t
         httpd_user_htaccess_t
         telepathy_mission_control_home_t
         qmail_inject_t
         gnome_home_t
         ...
         ...

But does this list show httpd_t as one of the domains? Let's try the same command with a filter:

seinfo -ruser_r -x | grep httpd

There are a number of httpd related domains the role has access to, but httpd_t is not one of them:

         httpd_user_htaccess_t
         httpd_user_script_exec_t
         httpd_user_ra_content_t
         httpd_user_rw_content_t
         httpd_user_script_t
         httpd_user_content_t

Taking this example then, if the restricteduser account tries to start the httpd daemon, the access should be denied because the httpd process runs within the httpd_t domain and that's not one of the domains the user_r role is authorized to access. And we know user_u (mapped to restricteduser) can assume user_r role. This should fail even if the restricteduser account has been granted sudo privilege.

Going back to the restricteduser account's terminal window, we try to start the httpd daemon now (we were able to stop it before because the account was granted sudo privilege):

[restricteduser@localhost ~]$ sudo service httpd start

The access is denied:

sudo: PERM_SUDOERS: setresuid(-1, 1, -1): Operation not permitted

So there is another example of how SELinux can work like a gatekeeper.
SELinux Audit Logs

As a system administrator, you would be interested to look at the error messages logged by SELinux. These messages are logged in specific files and they can provide detailed information about access denials. In a CentOS 7 system you can look at two files:

    /var/log/audit/audit.log
    /var/log/messages

These files are populated by the auditd daemon and the rsyslogd daemon respectively. So what do these daemons do? The man pages say the auditd daemon is the userspace component of the Linux auditing system and rsyslogd is the system utility providing support for message logging. Put simply, these daemons log error messages in these two files.

The /var/log/audit/audit.log file will be used if the auditd daemon is running. The /var/log/messages file is used if auditd is stopped and rsyslogd is running. If both the daemons are running, both the files are used: /var/log/audit/audit.log records detailed information while an easy-to-read version is kept in /var/log/messages.
Deciphering SELinux Error Messages

We looked at one SELinux error message in an earlier section (refer to "SELinux in Action 2: Restricting Permissions to Run Scripts"). We were then using the grep command to sift through /var/log/messages file. Fortunately SELinux comes with a few tools to make life a bit easier than that. These tools are not installed by default and require installing a few packages, which you should have installed in the first part of this tutorial.

The first command is ausearch. We can make use of this command if the auditd daemon is running. In the following code snippet we are trying to look at all the error messages related to the httpd daemon. Make sure you are in your root account:

ausearch -m avc -c httpd

In our system a number of entries were listed, but we will concentrate on the last one:

----
time->Thu Aug 21 16:42:17 2014
...
type=AVC msg=audit(1408603337.115:914): avc:  denied  { getattr } for  pid=10204 comm="httpd" path="/www/html/index.html" dev="dm-0" ino=8445484 scontext=system_u:system_r:httpd_t:s0 tcontext=unconfined_u:object_r:default_t:s0 tclass=file

Even experienced system administrators can get confused by messages like this unless they know what they are looking for. To understand it, let's take apart each of the fields:

    type=AVC and avc: AVC stands for Access Vector Cache. SELinux caches access control decisions for resource and processes. This cache is known as the Access Vector Cache (AVC). That's why SELinux access denial messages are also known as "AVC denials". These two fields of information are saying the entry is coming from an AVC log and it's an AVC event.

    denied { getattr }: The permission that was attempted and the result it got. In this case the get attribute operation was denied.

    pid=10204. This is the process id of the process that attempted the access.

    comm: The process id by itself doesn't mean much. The comm attribute shows the process command. In this case it's httpd. Immediately we know the error is coming from the web server.

    path: The location of the resource that was accessed. In this case it's a file under /www/html/index.html.

    dev and ino: The device where the target resource resides and its inode address.

    scontext: The security context of the process. We can see the source is running under the httpd_t domain.

    tcontext: The security context of the target resource. In this case the file type is default_t.

    tclass: The class of the target resource. In this case it's a file.

If you look closely, the process domain is httpd_t and the file's type context is default_t. Since the httpd daemon runs within a confined domain and SELinux policy stipulates this domain doesn't have any access to files with default_t type, the access was denied.

We have already seen the sealert tool. This command can be used with the id value of the error message logged in the /var/log/messages file.

In the following code snippet we again grep through the the /var/log/message file for SELinux related errors:

cat /var/log/messages | grep "SELinux is preventing"

In our system, we look at the very last error. This is the error that was logged when our restricteduser tried to run the httpd daemon:

...
Aug 25 11:59:46 localhost setroubleshoot: SELinux is preventing /usr/bin/su from using the setuid capability. For complete SELinux messages. run sealert -l e9e6c6d8-f217-414c-a14e-4bccb70cfbce

As suggested, we ran sealert with the ID value and were able to see the details (your ID value should be unique to your system):

sealert -l e9e6c6d8-f217-414c-a14e-4bccb70cfbce

SELinux is preventing /usr/bin/su from using the setuid capability.

...

Raw Audit Messages
type=AVC msg=audit(1408931985.387:850): avc:  denied  { setuid } for  pid=5855 comm="sudo" capability=7  scontext=user_u:user_r:user_t:s0 tcontext=user_u:user_r:user_t:s0 tclass=capability

Hash: su,user_t,user_t,capability,setuid

We have seen how the first few lines of the output of sealert tell us about the remediation steps. However, if we now look near the end of the output stream, we can see the "Raw Audit Messages" section. The entry here is coming from the audit.log file, which we discussed earlier, so you can use that section to help you interpret the output here.
Multilevel Security

Multilevel security or MLS is the fine-grained part of an SELinux security context.

So far in our discussion about security contexts for processes, users, or resources we have been talking about three attributes: SELinux user, SELinux role, and SELinux type or domain. The fourth field of the security context shows the sensitivity and optionally, the category of the resource.

To understand it, let's consider the security context of the FTP daemon's configuration file:

ls -Z /etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf

The fourth field of the security context shows a sensitivity of s0.

-rw-------. root root system_u:object_r:etc_t:s0       /etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf

The sensitivity is part of the hierarchical multilevel security mechanism. By hierarchy, we mean the levels of sensitivity can go deeper and deeper for more secured content in the file system. Level 0 (depicted by s0) is the lowest sensitivity level, comparable to say, "public." There can be other sensitivity levels with higher s values: for example, internal, confidential, or regulatory can be depicted by s1, s2, and s3 respectively. This mapping is not stipulated by the policy: system administrators can configure what each sensitivity level mean.

When a SELinux enabled system uses MLS for its policy type (configured in the /etc/selinux/config file), it can mark certain files and processes with certain levels of sensitivity. The lowest level is called "current sensitivity" and the highest level is called "clearance sensitivity".

Going hand-in-hand with sensitivity is the category of the resource, depicted by c. Categories can be considered as labels assigned to a resource. Examples of categories can be department names, customer names, projects etc. The purpose of categorization is to further fine-tune access control. For example, you can mark certain files with confidential sensitivity for users from two different internal departments.

For SELinux security contexts, sensitivity and category work together when a category is implemented. When using a range of sensitivity levels, the format is to show sensitivity levels separated by a hyphen (for example, s0-s2). When using a category, a range is shown with a dot in between. Sensitivity and category values are separated by a colon (:).

Here is an example of sensitivity / category pair:

user_u:object_r:etc_t:s0:c0.c2  

There is only one sensitivity level here and that's s0. The category level could also be written as c0-c2.

So where do you assign your category levels? Let's find the details from the /etc/selinux/targeted/setrans.conf file:

cat /etc/selinux/targeted/setrans.conf

#
# Multi-Category Security translation table for SELinux
#
#
# Objects can be categorized with 0-1023 categories defined by the admin.
# Objects can be in more than one category at a time.
# Categories are stored in the system as c0-c1023.  Users can use this
# table to translate the categories into a more meaningful output.
# Examples:
# s0:c0=CompanyConfidential
# s0:c1=PatientRecord
# s0:c2=Unclassified
# s0:c3=TopSecret
# s0:c1,c3=CompanyConfidentialRedHat
s0=SystemLow
s0-s0:c0.c1023=SystemLow-SystemHigh
s0:c0.c1023=SystemHigh

We won't go into the details of sensitivities and categories here. Just know that a process is allowed read access to a resource only when its sensitivity and category level is higher than that of the resource (i.e. the process domain dominates the resource type). The process can write to the resource when its sensitivity/category level is less than that of the resource.
Conclusion

We have tried to cover a broad topic on Linux security in the short span of this three-part-series. If we look at our system now, we have a simple Apache web server installed with its content being served from a custom directory. We also have an FTP daemon running in our server. There were a few users created whose access have been restricted. As we went along, we used SELinux packages, files, and commands to cater to our security needs. Along the way we also learned how to look at SELinux error messages and make sense of them.

Entire books have been written on the SELinux topic and you can spend hours trying to figure out different packages, configuration files, commands, and their effects on security. So where do you go from here?

One thing I would do is caution you not to test anything on a production system. Once you have mastered the basics, start playing with SELinux by enabling it on a test replica of your production box. Make sure the audit daemons are running and keep an eye on the error messages. Check any denials preventing services from starting. Play around with the boolean settings. Make a list of possible steps for securing your system, like creating new users mapped to least-privilged SELinux accounts or applying the right context to non-standard file locations. Understand how to decipher an error log. Check the ports for various daemons: if non-standard ports are used, make sure they are correctly assigned to the policy.

It will all come together with time and practice. :)

It looks like date is simply reporting an error that it received from
the operating system.   The strace utility (or some platform-specific
replacement if you are not using Linux) should be able to confirm
this.

This is almost certainly because the date program understands the date
you refer to, but failed in its attempt to set the system clock to
that value.

More likely it's because CET is 1h ahead of UTC and therefore the time
you specified is before the Epoch.    But Eric already said that, so
perhaps you ruled out that possibility but did not say so.

       Open Source Storage: 64 Applications for Data Storage
       19-24 minutes
       
       As data storage needs continue to grow and many organizations move toward software-defined infrastructure, more enterprises are using open source software to meet some of their storage needs. Projects like Hadoop, Ceph, Gluster and others have become very common at large enterprises.
       
       Home users and small businesses can also benefit from open source storage software. These applications can make it possible to set up your own NAS or SAN device using industry-standard hardware without paying the high prices vendors charge for dedicated storage appliances. Open source software also offers users the option to set up a cloud storage solution where they have control over security and privacy, and it can also offer affordable options for backup and recovery.
       
       The list below features 64 open source storage projects that are among the best options available for enterprises, SMBs and individual users. Please note that this is not a ranking. Entries are organized into categories and then alphabetized within the categories.

$ yum list docker-ce --showduplicates | sort -r    | apt-cache madison docker-ce
________________________
yum upgrade forces the removal of obsolete packages, while yum update may or may not also do this. The removal of obsolete packages can be risky, as it may remove packages that you use.

This makes yum update the safer option.

From man yum:

    update

    If run without any packages, update will update every currently installed package. If one or more packages or package globs are specified, Yum will only update the listed packages. While updating packages, yum will ensure that all dependencies are satisfied. (See Specifying package names for more information) If the packages or globs specified match to packages which are not currently installed then update will not install them. update operates on groups, files, provides and filelists just like the "install" command. If the main obsoletes configure option is true (default) or the --obsoletes flag is present yum will include package obsoletes in its calculations - this makes it better for distro-version changes, for example: upgrading from somelinux 8.0 to somelinux 9.

    upgrade

    Is the same as the update command with the --obsoletes flag set. See update for more details
