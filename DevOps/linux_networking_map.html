nftables (Linux 3.13+ new packet filtering technology)
   Iptables             nftables 
 typically used for  more robust and
 security, access    easier to use than
 and firewall        iptables while 
  configuration.     offering similar
                     functionality  
                     backward-compatible
                     with iptables rules


Denise Dumas,Platform Engineering @ Red Hat,
"""iptables has always been difficult for customers to use successfully
and we have high hopes that nftables will provide a much more user-friendly experience."""
_________________________________
Networking also gets a boost in Linux 3.13 with a pair of innovations,  including the High-Availability Seamless Redundancy (HSR) standard that  is now supported in Linux, enabling a new approach for failover.
""It [HSR] requires a special network topology where all nodes are connected in a ring (each node having two physical network interfaces),""
 Linux developer Arvid Brodin wrote in his code commit message. ""It is suited for applications that demand high availability and very short reaction time.""

In addition to HSR, Linux 3.13 benefits from the TCP Fast Open specification, which is intended to accelerate the ability of a system 
to open up multiple Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connections. The technology first landed in the Linux 3.7 kernel  at the end of 2012 and is now enabled by default in the Linux 3.13 release.

""Applications have started to use Fast Open (e.g., Chrome browser has such an optional flag) and the feature has gone through several 
generations of kernels since 3.7 with many real network tests,"" Linux kernel developer Yuchung Cheng wrote in his code commit message. 
""It's time to enable this flag by default for applications to test more conveniently and extensively.""

DNSMasq: the way it works is simplicity at its finest. First, let's look at its features:
Extremely small memory and CPU footprint: I knew this was the case, because it's the program that runs on Linux-based consumer routers where
memory and CPU are at a premium.

DNS server: DNSMasq approaches DNS in a different way from the traditional BIND dæmon. It doesn't offer the complexity of domain
transfers, master/slave relationships and so on. It does offer extremely simple and highly configurable options that are, in my opinion, far
more useful in a small- to medium-size network. It even does reverse DNS (PTR records) automatically! (More on those details later.)

DHCP server: where the DNS portion of DNSMasq lacks in certain advanced features, the DHCP services offered actually are extremely robust. 
Most routers running firmware like DD-WRT don't offer a Web interface to the advanced features DNSMasq provides, but it rivals and even
surpasses some of the standalone DHCP servers.

TFTP server: working in perfect tandem with the advanced features of DHCP, DNSMasq even offers a built-in TFTP server for things like booting
thin clients or sending configuration files.

A single configuration file: it's possible to use multiple configuration files, and I even recommend it for clarity's sake. In the end, however,
DNSMasq requires you to edit only a single configuration file to manage all of its powerful services. That configuration file also is very well
commented, which makes using it much nicer.

Cilium is open source software for transparently securing the network 
connectivity between application services deployed using Linux container 
management platforms like Docker and Kubernetes. Cilium 1.0.0-rc4 has recently 
been released, which includes: the Cloud Native Computing Foundation 
(CNCF)-hosted Envoy configured as the default HTTP/gRPC proxy; the addition of 
a simple health overview for connectivity and other errors; and an improved 
scalable kvstore interaction layer.

Microservices applications tend to be highly dynamic, and this presents both a 
challenge and an opportunity in terms of securing connectivity between 
microservices. Modern approaches to overcoming this issue have coalesced around
the CNCF-hosted Container Network Interface (CNI) and the increasingly popular 
"service mesh" technologies, such as Istio and Conduit. According to the Cilium
documentation, traditional Linux network security approaches (such as iptables)
filter on IP address and TCP/UDP ports. However, the highly volatile life cycle
of containers and IP addresses cause these approaches to struggle to scale 
alongside the application as the large number of load balancing tables and 
access control lists must be updated continually.

Cilium attempts to address the issue with scaling by utilising a (relatively) 
new technology called Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF). BPF is a Linux kernel 
bytecode interpreter that was originally introduced to filter network packets, 
as seen in tcpdump and socket filters. It has been extended with additional 
data structures such as hash tables and arrays as well as additional actions to
support packet mangling, forwarding, encapsulation, etc. An in-kernel verifier 
ensures that BPF programs are safe to run and a JIT compiler converts the 
bytecode to CPU architecture specific instructions for native execution 
efficiency. For readers keen to explore BPF in further detail, performance Guru
