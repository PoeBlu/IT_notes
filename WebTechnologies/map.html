TODO: promises, async, await

With v3.2 we decided to support Promises (and for the sake of cross 
compatibility we also added a custom polyfill). We also introduced async 
functions which returns Promises like this one: 
http://doc.babylonjs.com/api/interfaces/babylon.isceneloaderpluginasync#loadassetcontainerasync

When a function returns a promise, modern browsers let us use the new await keyword. This new keyword (which will be familiar for C# developer) let you create asynchronous code like it would be synchronous:
1 // load the assets
2 var rootURL = 'https://models.babylonjs.com';
3 var filename = 'ufo.glb';
4 var container = await BABYLON.SceneLoader.LoadAssetContainerAsync(rootURl, filename, scene);
5 container.addAllToScene();
6  
7 scene.createDefaultEnvrionment();

  The D3 team has announced their 5.0 release, which embraces several newer asynchronous patterns such as promises and fetch, and updates key visualization APIs.
  
  D3.js is a JavaScript library for producing dynamic, interactive data visualizations in web browsers. As stated in the D3 5.0 release notes::
  
      With the adoption of promises, D3 now uses the Fetch API instead of XMLHttpRequest: the d3-request module has been replaced by d3-fetch. Fetch supports many powerful new features, such as streaming responses.

Jison takes a context-free grammar as input and outputs a JavaScript  file capable of parsing the language described by that grammar. You can  then use the generated script to parse inputs and accept, reject, or perform actions based on the input. If you’re familiar with Bison or Yacc, or other clones, you’re almost ready to roll.

Flow uses type inference to find bugs even without type annotations. It precisely tracks the types of variables as they flow through your program.

Flow is designed for JavaScript programmers. It understands common JavaScript idioms and very dynamic code.

Flow incrementally rechecks your changes as you work, preserving the fast feedback cycle of developing plain JavaScript.

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTML/Canvas/Drawing_Graphics_with_Canvas

Mozilla's canvas is extended with the drawWindow() method. This method draws a snapshot of the contents of a DOM window into the canvas. For example,
        
ctx.drawWindow(window, 0, 0, 100, 200, "rgb(255,255,255)");

would draw the contents of the current window, in the rectangle (0,0,100,200) in pixels relative to the top-left of the viewport, on a white background, into the canvas. By specifying "rgba(255,255,255,0)" as the color, the contents would be drawn with a transparent background (which would be slower).

It is usually a bad idea to use any background other than pure white "rgb(255,255,255)" or transparent, as this is what all browsers do, and many websites expect that transparent parts of their interface will be drawn on white background.
______________________
let allows you to declare variables that are limited in scope to the block, statement, or expression on which it is used. This is unlike the var keyword, which defines a variable globally, or locally to an entire function regardless of block scope.

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Apps/Getting_Started

Web apps are apps built using standard Web technologies. They work in any modern Web browser, and can be developed using your favorite tools. Some characteristics that distinguish Web apps from websites: Apps are installed by a user, they are self-contained and don't always require the chrome of a browser window, and they can be built to run offline. Gmail, Twitter, and Etherpad are Web apps.

The Mozilla Open Web Apps project proposes some small additions to existing sites to turn them into apps that run in a rich, fun, and powerful computing environment. These apps run on desktop browsers and mobile devices, and are easier for a user to discover and launch than Web sites. They have access to a growing set of novel features, such as synchronizing across all of a user's devices.

</pre>
   -----------------------------------------------
   Props&States
<pre xxxsmall zoom>
Setting the state:

The initial state of the component isn't actually required, but if your component uses state, it should be set.

import React, { Component } from 'react'; 
 
export default class MyComponent extends Component { 
 
  state = { first: false, second: true, } // Init. state
 
  render() { 
    const { first, second } = this.state;  // <-- init with state
    return ( 
      <main> 
        <section> <button disabled={first} >First </button> </section> 
        <section> <button disabled={second}>Second</button> </section> 
      </main> 
    ); 
  } 
---- Usage: (will use init state --------------------
import { render } from 'react-dom'; 
import MyComponent from './MyComponent'; 
const comp1 = render( (<MyComponent />), document.getElementById('app') ); 
setTimeout(() => { comp1.setState({ first: true }); }, 3000); // <- Change state on timeout
_______________________
default properties:

import React, { Component } from 'react'; 
 
export default class MyButton extends Component { 
  // Notice the static (=> Non-instance, global to class)
  // Properties are inmutable.(vs state that changes all the time)
  static defaultProps = {  // <- used when the same property
    disabled: false,       // isn't passed to the JSX element
    text: 'My Button', 
  } 
 
  render() { 
    // defaultProps.disabled used since nothing is passed in the JSX
    const { disabled, text } = this.props; // <-- init with props.
    return ( 
      <button disabled={disabled}>{text}</button> 
    );
  }
}

Render without passing any property values. 
render( (<MyButton />), document.getElementById('app') ); 
_______________________
</pre>
   -----------------------------------------------
   Container Pattern
<pre xxxsmall zoom>
The basic premise of container components is simple: don't couple data fetching with the component that renders the data. The container is responsible for fetching the data and passing it to its child component. It contains the component responsible for rendering the data.

The idea is that you should be able to achieve some level of substitutability with this pattern. For example, a container could substitute its child component. Or, a child component could be used in a different container. Let's see the container pattern in action, starting with the container itself:
___________________________
import React, { Component } from 'react';

import MyList from './MyList';

function /*mock service*/ fetchData() {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      resolve([ 'First', 'Second', 'Third', ]);
    }, 2000);
  });
}

export default class MyContainer extends Component {
  // The container should always have an initial state,
  // (passed down to child components as properties)
  state = { items: [] }

  componentDidMount() /*call after comp. rendering */{ 
    fetchData() /*change state when data arrives */
      .then(items => this.setState({ items }));
  }

  // Renders the containee, passing state as properties, 
  // using the spread operator: "...".
  render() {
    return (
      <MyList {...this.state} />
    );
  }
}
___________________________
   Event Handling
<pre xxxsmall zoom>
The differentiating factor with event handling in React components is that it's declarative. Contrast this with something like jQuery, where you have to write imperative code that selects the relevant DOM elements and attaches event handler functions to them.

The advantage with the declarative approach of event handlers in JSX markup is that they're part of the UI structure. Not having to track down code that assigns event handlers is mentally liberating.
__________________________________________
import React, { Component } from 'react'; 
 
export default class MyButton extends Component { 
   onClick() { console.log('clicked'); } 

  render() { 
    return ( 
    <button onClick={this.onClick}> {this.props.children} </button> 
    ); 
  } 
}

https://medium.com/@maybekatz/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner-55f7d4bd282b

Those of you upgrading npm to its latest version, npm@5.2.0, might notice that it installs a new binary alongside the usual npm: npx.

Have you ever run into a situation where you want to try some CLI tool, but it’s annoying to have to install a global just to run it once? npx is great for that, too. Calling npx <command> when <command> isn’t already in your $PATH will automatically install a package with that name from the npm registry for you, and invoke it. When it’s done, the installed package won’t be anywhere in your globals, so you won’t have to worry about pollution in the long-term.
