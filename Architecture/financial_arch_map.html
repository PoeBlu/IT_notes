  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_instrument">Financial instruments Classification</a>
<pre xxxsmall zoom>
Main classification:
  * Cash instruments – instruments whose value is determined directly by 
    the <a href="/wiki/Market_(economics)" title="Market (economics)">markets</a>.
    They can be <a href="/wiki/Security_(finance)" title="Security (finance)">securities</a>,
    which are readily transferable, and instruments such as <a href="/wiki/Loans" class="mw-redirect" title="Loans">loans</a>
    and <a href="/wiki/Deposit_(finance)" title="Deposit (finance)">deposits</a>, where both borrower and lender have to agree on a transfer.
  
  * <a href="/wiki/Derivative_(finance)" title="Derivative (finance)">Derivative instruments</a> – 
    instruments which derive their value from the value and characteristics 
    of one or more underlying entities such as an <a href="/wiki/Asset" title="Asset">asset</a>,
    index, or <a href="/wiki/Interest_rate" title="Interest rate">interest rate</a>.
    They can be <a href="/wiki/Derivative_(finance)#OTC_and_exchange-traded" title="Derivative (finance)">exchange-traded derivatives</a> 
    and <a href="/wiki/Derivative_(finance)#OTC_and_exchange-traded" title="Derivative (finance)">over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives</a>.


Alternatively, financial instruments may be categorized by "asset class" 
depending on whether they are equity-based (reflecting <a href="/wiki/Ownership" title="Ownership">ownership</a>
of the issuing entity) or debt-based (reflecting a loan the investor has made to the issuing entity). 
If the instrument is debt, it can be further categorised into short-term (
less than one year) or long-term. Foreign exchange instruments and 
transactions are neither debt- nor equity-based and belong in their own category.

Banking communication  protocols

  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/understanding-banking-communication-three-channels-ebics-gross">Understanding Banking Comunication (EBICS, Host-to-Host, SWIFT)</a>
<pre xxxsmall zoom>
Banking communication can be very complex and even confusing, especially when 
it comes to payments. Even people who work with payments on a daily basis 
often don?t understand the specific technical details behind them. After all, 
they are finance experts, working in accounting and treasury, and not payment 
technology experts. So how do we best determine the right setup for a 
company?
The three main channels

Which payment communication channels exist? Before you consider specific 
solutions or combinations for a company, you should take a closer look at 
what is actually available.

EBICS

EBICS is the German payments standard and is regulated by ?Deutsche 
Kreditwirtschaft (DK),? a consortium made up of the Official Associations of 
a number of German bank types. It represents a very powerful combination of a 
standard channel and a standard format (SEPA, previously DTAUS). 
Communication is based on the TCP/IP Protocol. Authorized signatories are 
specified in the EBICS contracts and their signatures are called up for any 
communication with the banking server. Only once these signatures have been 
validated in connection with the type of instruction communicated at the same 
time (e.g. CCT for the SEPA DK format) does the banking server accept the 
file and log the result.

The back-ends of German banks are set up to meet the requirements of this 
communication method perfectly. All German banks use the EBICS standard, 
making it the most commonly used channel for payments within Germany.

Host-to-host (H2H)

A so-called host-to-host connection essentially represents a bilateral 
agreement between a company and a bank to exchange information. The bank 
defines the standard for the company. Generally, these connections are based 
on SFTP and HTTPS protocols that are already encrypted (SSH or SSL). However, 
some banks require additional file encryption with OpenPGP. There is a Single 
Point of Entry, i.e. a central interface, and the bank then forwards the 
information to their branches worldwide. The disadvantage of this solution is 
the lack of a clearly defined, common standard. Moreover, this solution is 
more complex to set up and requires more involvement by internal IT. The 
advantage is that the absence of regulation means no friction losses. Host-to-
host can be a very good solution for global payments, in particular if a 
company works with only a few main banks.

SWIFT

SWIFT is in a way a combination of EBICS and host-to-host. SWIFT has 
introduced SCORE (Standardised Corporate Environment), a clearly defined 
standard with clear rules for global payments. They specify in detail which 
financial messages may be exchanged by companies and financial institutes. A 
so-called SCORE Agreement needs to be drawn up; this is necessary but pretty 
straightforward. Once the agreement has been signed, corporates are 
authenticated in the SWIFT Network based on their company-own BIC. The 
infrastructure required for this is either supplied by a SaaS provider, a 
SWIFT Service Bureau or a local installation set up by internal IT. Unlike 
with EBICS and comparable to host-to-host, this means communicating globally 
with the banks? back-ends and forwarding files to the international branches. 
This solution makes sense if a company uses many different banks worldwide.

In reality, most companies use a combination of these solutions. The 
following example illustrates this: A company works with 20 banks in Germany 
and has therefore set up EBICS incl. SEPA. In addition, they have one main 
bank through which they process 70% of their global payments. For this, they 
use a host-to-host connection. For the remaining 30% of payments the company 
works with other global banks and has set up SWIFT to do so. Each company 
requires a detailed analysis of their banking landscape and needs to work out 
which volume of payments will make a host-to-host connection useful.

So why do many companies struggle to find the right payments solution? One of 
the problems is that quite often the only person they can turn to for advice 
is a member of the bank?s sales team. Here, they get information but they don?
t understand the technology behind the proposed solutions, and this makes it 
very difficult to form a neutral opinion. This is why it can make great sense 
to also talk to, for example, the provider of a treasury management system. 
The technology is there but companies need to make the best possible use of it
, and for this they require background information

S4 (Applicability Statement 4) is a Conformance Profile of the OASIS ebMS 3.0 
specification,[1] and represents an open standard for the secure and payload-agnostic
exchange of Business-to-business documents using Web services. Secure document 
exchange is governed by aspects of WS-Security, including XML Encryption and 
XML Digital Signatures. Payload agnosticism refers to the document type (e.g. 
purchase order, invoice, etc.) not being tied to any defined SOAP action or 
operation.

AS4 became a standard in 2013.[2] The majority of the AS4 profiling points 
constraining the ebMS 3.0 specification are based upon the functional 
requirements of the AS2 specification. By scaling back ebMS 3.0 using AS2 as 
a blueprint, AS4 provides an entry-level on-ramp for Web services B2B by 
simplifying the complexities of Web services.[clarification needed]

Key Technical Highlights

    Support for SOAP 1.1 and 1.2 enveloping structure
    Payload agnosticism
    Support for single or multiple payloads contained either within the SOAP 
        body or as SOAP attachment(s)
    Support for payload compression
    Support for message-level security including various combinations of XML 
        Digital Signature and/or XML Encryption
    Support for X.509 security tokens and username/password tokens
    Support for business receipt of non-repudiation similar to the Message 
        Disposition Notification (MDN)[3] used by AS2 and specified as an XML 
        schema by the ebXML BPSS group
    Support for the ebMS 3.0 One-Way/Push message exchange pattern with support
        for either synchronous or asynchronous responses
    Support for the ebMS 3.0 One-Way/Pull message exchange pattern which is

<pre xxxsmall zoom>
Calypso is a set of specifications describing a fast and secure off-line 
contactless transaction, between a portable object and a terminal. It has 
been created at the end of the 1990s by some european public transport 
operators or authority (RATP and SNCF in Paris and all France, STIB in 
Brussels, OTLIS in Lisbon, ACTV in Venice, Konstanz in Germany), in order to 
create an open , interoperable and secure standard independent from 
industrials to ensure a real competition.

Today Calypso represent 20% of the world market of contactless smart 
ticketing in 25 countries and 125 cities. It brings to his user a guarantee 
of security and interoperability which relies on a total compliance with 
existing standards  (ISO 14443, ISO 7816-4, Global Platform). The Calypso 
standard is managed by the Calypso Networks Association (CNA) , which is led 
by transports operators and public authorities in order to ensure openness 
and independence from industrials in confront of other proprietary schemes.

The openness for a contactless ticketing standard can be evaluated for the 
two mains components of ticketing systems, with the complementary concern 
about guarantee of security:

    Cards and portable objects (mobile phones, Java objects, wearables, …)
    Terminals (validators, vending equipment, …)

Europe GDP settled every 5 days.

TARGET2 is based on a technically centralised platform ? the SSP ? and all users, irrespective 
of their location, have access to the same services, functionalities and inter faces at the same

The SSP of TARGET2 was set up using a modular approach. Every module in the SSP is closely 
related to a specific service (e.g. the Payments Module for the processing of payments). Some 
of the modules (Home Accounting, Standing Facilities and Reserve Management Modules) 
can be used by individual central banks on an optional basis. Central banks that do not use 
these modules offer the respective services via proprietary applications in their domestic 
technical environments.
SWIFT standards and services (e.g. FIN, InterAct, FileAct and Browse) are used to enable 
standardised communication between the TARGET2 system and its participants. Since 
November 2010 TARGET2 has also offered internet-based access for low-volume participants

With instant payments, the funds will be available immediately for use by the recipient, 24/7/365.
From an end-user perspective, the benefit of instant payments is the ability to make time-sensitive payments immediately, wherever and whenever necessary. The implementation of instant payments may also provide the basis for service enhancements and value-added services, e.g. person-to-person mobile payments.
Payment service providers are encouraged to make instant payment solutions in euro available at a pan-European level as of November 2017. Although it is not mandatory for payment service providers to offer SCTinst, it is expected that a large number of them will do so.
The TIPS pricing policy will favour reachability. The entry and maintenance fees for an account in TIPS will be set at zero. The charges to be paid per transaction will be proportional to the volume of instant payments processed via TIPS in order to comply with our full cost recovery principle. In this context, the feedback on expected volumes in the market consultation was very encouraging. It exceeded the volumes initially estimated by the Eurosystem both as regards total market volumes and the volumes that market participants would expect to process in TIPS. The Eurosystem will offer the service to banks at the price of a maximum of 0.20 eurocent (?0.0020) per payment for at least the first two years of operation.

<pre xxxsmall zoom>
When you make a cross-border payment in euros, Romanian lei and Swedish krona within the EU, your bank can't charge you more than it would for an equivalent national transaction. Even banks based in EU countries outside the euro area must apply this rule.

This includes any:

    transfers between bank accounts in different EU countries
    withdrawals from cash machines/ATMs in EU countries
    payments by debit or credit card across the EU
    direct debit transactions

For example, if your bank charges you 1 EUR each time you withdraw money in your home country from a cash machine outside your bank network, they can charge you the same amount when you make a withdrawal in another EU country.
Charges for using your card

When you pay for something in the EU using your credit or debit card, traders and banks cannot charge you an extra fee – also known as "surcharging" – just for using a particular card. This rule applies to all card purchases (in shops and online) made within your home country or in another EU country.

American Express, Diners Club, and business or corporate credit cards, where your employer is billed instead of you, are not covered by EU rules on payment services, and you can still be charged extra for using these cards.

You should be aware that if you're paying in EU currencies other than euros, you may still be charged a currency conversion fee by your card provider when you use your card in another country.
Sample story
You shouldn't be charged extra for using your card

Clara from Austria wanted to buy flight tickets online. She selected her tickets on the airline's website and went to pay. However, when she entered her credit card information, the airline added an extra EUR 10 to the cost of her order as a charge for using a VISA card.

Clara contacted her local European Consumer Centre, who raised a complaint with the airline. The airline refunded the EUR 10 charge for her booking, and modified their rules to remove the illegal surcharge from their booking process.
Card and payment fraud

EU rules limit the amount you can be asked to pay if you're the victim of card or payment fraud – where your card or your account is debited without your permission. In all cases, you can only be asked to pay a maximum of EUR 50 towards the cost of the fraudulent payments.

However, in cases where you were unaware of the loss, theft or misappropriation of funds (i.e. your account was hacked, or your card was cloned and charged without your knowledge), then you don't have to pay anything. Your bank or card provider should cover all the costs. This rule also applies if the loss was caused by a bank employee.
Blocked money on your card

Sometimes when you make a reservation, such as a hotel booking or car rental, you may be asked to give your card details to guarantee your booking. The trader may also ask to block a certain amount of money on your card when you make your reservation. This means  the trader reserves part of your credit limit or account balance  to cover any charge they expect you to build up, such as room service in a hotel, or possible damage to a hire car.

You should be informed by the trader if they intend to block an amount on your credit card, and you must give your approval for this and for the exact amount being blocked.

As soon as you have made the real payment – for example, when you check out of your hotel and use your credit card to pay for your room, or when you return your hire car and pay the final bill – the bank must immediately release the blocked amount from your credit card.  
Sample story
Blocked amounts must be released as soon as you pay

Boris from Hungary went to Venice for the weekend with his girlfriend. When they arrived at their hotel, the hotel took a copy of Boris' credit card. The hotel informed Boris that they would like to block EUR 500 to cover his reservation and any use of the mini-bar and restaurant services during their stay. Boris agreed to have his card blocked with this amount.

Before leaving the hotel, Boris paid his hotel bill using his credit card. A week later, when he tried to book some flights with his credit card, Boris realised that EUR 500 was still blocked on his credit card. He called the hotel to complain, who apologised for their mistake and immediately asked the bank to release the blocked amount.
Direct debits

If you have a direct debit set up from your bank account, it  may happen that a payment is made by mistake or the wrong amount is taken – for example if you cancelled a contract with a supplier, but the direct debit was still made after the contract was terminated. In these situations, you have the right to get a payment refunded within 8 weeks. This applies to all direct debits, both within your home country and cross-border direct debits within the EU.
What to do if you have a problem

If you have any problems making payments within the EU, you should contact your bank or card provider. They must give a written response to your complaint within 15 days (or up to 35 days in certain exceptional circumstances). They should also have a formal complaints procedure in place for consumers.

If you need any help getting your rights recognised, you can contact FIN-NET for problems with financial service providers, or ECC-Net for problems with traders.
Cheques

EU rules on bank charges for international and national payments do not apply to cheques.

There are sometimes very high transaction fees for cashing a cheque from another EU country. In many countries, cheques are also no longer accepted as a means of payment.

  <a href="https://www.blockchaindailynews.com/SWIFT-Blockchain-PoC-Final-Verdict-Back-office-Standardisation-prerequisite-for-DLT-adoption_a26324.html">SWIFT Blockchain PoC</a>
  <ul xxxsmall zoom>
  <li>In December 2017, I wrote about the SWIFT Blockchain Proof of concept (PoC), and why I felt that the result was most likely going to be "DLT for international payments processing is still work in progress".</li>
  <li>SWIFT finally released the results of the PoC this month and have confirmed that there is a lot more work needed within Banks' back office technology and operational processes for DLT to be relevant.</li>
  <li>The PoC was aimed at international payments and how intraday/real time liquidity management could be performed using DLT. Correspondent banks provide services on behalf of another overseas financial institution through a correspondent account (Nostro/ Vostro account). However, about 34% of the cost of an international payment is related to Nostro trapped liquidity. This is due to the lack of real-time data to optimize intraday liquidity management.</li>
  <li>Managing Nostro accounts and ensuring there is no over funding or overusage of credit lines depend on availability of real time data. A real-time feed of transaction data would allow banks to release payments to customers quicker, whilst reducing liquidity risks.</li>
  <li>With that as the driver behind the initiative, a consortium of 34 banks worked on this use case with SWIFT. In Q1 2017 SWIFT had launched their Global Payments Initiative (GPI) with these banks and it went live without DLT. SWIFT wanted to get their product out using legacy systems, and not wait for the results of the DLT prototype.</li>
  <li>The results of the DLT prototype are as follows:
<pre>
Nostro DLT application, combined with the ISO 20022 data model, delivered the 
business functionalities and data richness required for automated real-time 
liquidity monitoring and reconciliation. Real-time confirmation of each account
entry and use of the unique end-to-end transaction reference (UETR) - SWIFT's 
central payments tracker, made it possible.

Further progress is needed on DLT technology before it is ready to support 
applications in large scale critical global infrastructures. 528 channels were 
required in the PoC to ensure Nostro accounts would only be stored on the nodes
 of their account servicers and owners. But when the solution is in production,
 more than 100,000 such channels would need to be defined. DLT solution hasn't 
matured yet to handle that load

All Nostro Account service providers will need to migrate their back-office liq
uidity reporting process from Batch to real time processing. ISO 20022, will ne
ed to be applied across banks to ensure data shared across different banks has 
consistent data elements. Such a common data model is essential to reduce integ
ration costs (between SWIFT and the banks).

We will continue our R&D efforts to ensure that SWIFT customers will be able to
 leverage their existing SWIFT infrastructure and connectivity to benefit from 
blockchain services, whether offered by SWIFT or by third parties, on a secure 
and trusted platform.
Stephen Gilderdale, Chief Platform Officer, SWIFT

While the existing GPI has been successful for SWIFT, for the GPI to use DLT, i
t requires all banks to have a real time infrastructure. SWIFT is currently foc
used on helping that transformation happen.
Adoption of ISO 20022 is a pre-requisite to save costs before DLT can be beta t
ested for wider adoption. As this progresses, SWIFT will continue to explore ad
vancements within the DLT space to ensure there are no non-functional performan
ce/scaling challenges.
I see this as a major setback for banks' adoption of Blockchain. If banks' back
 office processes and technologies need to be transformed before DLT can be use
d, we may have to wait for a good part of another decade.
The official press release mentions that it is a question of "when rather than 
an if" for DLT to be used in this context. However, I believe that is a gross u
nderestimation of banks' inability to transform their back office technology an
d operational processes.
