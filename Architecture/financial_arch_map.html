</li>
  <li>The Disruptor is the result of our research and testing. We found that cache misses at the CPU-level, and locks requiring kernel arbitration are both extremely costly, so we created a framework which has "mechanical sympathy" for the hardware it's running on, and that's lock-free.</li>

  <a href="https://www.blockchaindailynews.com/SWIFT-Blockchain-PoC-Final-Verdict-Back-office-Standardisation-prerequisite-for-DLT-adoption_a26324.html">SWIFT Blockchain PoC</a>
  <ul xxxsmall zoom>
  <li>In December 2017, I wrote about the SWIFT Blockchain Proof of concept (PoC), and why I felt that the result was most likely going to be "DLT for international payments processing is still work in progress".</li>
  <li>SWIFT finally released the results of the PoC this month and have confirmed that there is a lot more work needed within Banks' back office technology and operational processes for DLT to be relevant.</li>
  <li>The PoC was aimed at international payments and how intraday/real time liquidity management could be performed using DLT. Correspondent banks provide services on behalf of another overseas financial institution through a correspondent account (Nostro/ Vostro account). However, about 34% of the cost of an international payment is related to Nostro trapped liquidity. This is due to the lack of real-time data to optimize intraday liquidity management.</li>
  <li>Managing Nostro accounts and ensuring there is no over funding or overusage of credit lines depend on availability of real time data. A real-time feed of transaction data would allow banks to release payments to customers quicker, whilst reducing liquidity risks.</li>
  <li>With that as the driver behind the initiative, a consortium of 34 banks worked on this use case with SWIFT. In Q1 2017 SWIFT had launched their Global Payments Initiative (GPI) with these banks and it went live without DLT. SWIFT wanted to get their product out using legacy systems, and not wait for the results of the DLT prototype.</li>
  <li>The results of the DLT prototype are as follows:
<pre>
Nostro DLT application, combined with the ISO 20022 data model, delivered the 
business functionalities and data richness required for automated real-time 
liquidity monitoring and reconciliation. Real-time confirmation of each account
entry and use of the unique end-to-end transaction reference (UETR) - SWIFT's 
central payments tracker, made it possible.

Further progress is needed on DLT technology before it is ready to support 
applications in large scale critical global infrastructures. 528 channels were 
required in the PoC to ensure Nostro accounts would only be stored on the nodes
 of their account servicers and owners. But when the solution is in production,
 more than 100,000 such channels would need to be defined. DLT solution hasn't 
matured yet to handle that load

All Nostro Account service providers will need to migrate their back-office liq
uidity reporting process from Batch to real time processing. ISO 20022, will ne
ed to be applied across banks to ensure data shared across different banks has 
consistent data elements. Such a common data model is essential to reduce integ
ration costs (between SWIFT and the banks).

We will continue our R&D efforts to ensure that SWIFT customers will be able to
 leverage their existing SWIFT infrastructure and connectivity to benefit from 
blockchain services, whether offered by SWIFT or by third parties, on a secure 
and trusted platform.
Stephen Gilderdale, Chief Platform Officer, SWIFT

While the existing GPI has been successful for SWIFT, for the GPI to use DLT, i
t requires all banks to have a real time infrastructure. SWIFT is currently foc
used on helping that transformation happen.
Adoption of ISO 20022 is a pre-requisite to save costs before DLT can be beta t
ested for wider adoption. As this progresses, SWIFT will continue to explore ad
vancements within the DLT space to ensure there are no non-functional performan
ce/scaling challenges.
I see this as a major setback for banks' adoption of Blockchain. If banks' back
 office processes and technologies need to be transformed before DLT can be use
d, we may have to wait for a good part of another decade.
The official press release mentions that it is a question of "when rather than 
an if" for DLT to be used in this context. However, I believe that is a gross u
nderestimation of banks' inability to transform their back office technology an
d operational processes.

Resolution is the orderly restructuring of a bank by a resolution authority when the bank is failing or likely to fail. This procedure ensures that a bank failure does not harm the broader economy or cause financial instability.

The single resolution mechanism (SRM) applies to banks covered by the single supervisory mechanism. It is the second pillar of the banking union.

EU E-money Directive:

https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/consumers/financial-products-and-services/payments-transfers-cheques/index_en.htm
Payments, transfers and cheques

When you make a cross-border payment in euros, Romanian lei and Swedish krona within the EU, your bank can't charge you more than it would for an equivalent national transaction. Even banks based in EU countries outside the euro area must apply this rule.

This includes any:

    transfers between bank accounts in different EU countries
    withdrawals from cash machines/ATMs in EU countries
    payments by debit or credit card across the EU
    direct debit transactions

For example, if your bank charges you 1 EUR each time you withdraw money in your home country from a cash machine outside your bank network, they can charge you the same amount when you make a withdrawal in another EU country.
Charges for using your card

When you pay for something in the EU using your credit or debit card, traders and banks cannot charge you an extra fee – also known as "surcharging" – just for using a particular card. This rule applies to all card purchases (in shops and online) made within your home country or in another EU country.

American Express, Diners Club, and business or corporate credit cards, where your employer is billed instead of you, are not covered by EU rules on payment services, and you can still be charged extra for using these cards.

You should be aware that if you're paying in EU currencies other than euros, you may still be charged a currency conversion fee by your card provider when you use your card in another country.
Sample story
You shouldn't be charged extra for using your card

Clara from Austria wanted to buy flight tickets online. She selected her tickets on the airline's website and went to pay. However, when she entered her credit card information, the airline added an extra EUR 10 to the cost of her order as a charge for using a VISA card.

Clara contacted her local European Consumer Centre, who raised a complaint with the airline. The airline refunded the EUR 10 charge for her booking, and modified their rules to remove the illegal surcharge from their booking process.
Card and payment fraud

EU rules limit the amount you can be asked to pay if you're the victim of card or payment fraud – where your card or your account is debited without your permission. In all cases, you can only be asked to pay a maximum of EUR 50 towards the cost of the fraudulent payments.

However, in cases where you were unaware of the loss, theft or misappropriation of funds (i.e. your account was hacked, or your card was cloned and charged without your knowledge), then you don't have to pay anything. Your bank or card provider should cover all the costs. This rule also applies if the loss was caused by a bank employee.
Blocked money on your card

Sometimes when you make a reservation, such as a hotel booking or car rental, you may be asked to give your card details to guarantee your booking. The trader may also ask to block a certain amount of money on your card when you make your reservation. This means  the trader reserves part of your credit limit or account balance  to cover any charge they expect you to build up, such as room service in a hotel, or possible damage to a hire car.

You should be informed by the trader if they intend to block an amount on your credit card, and you must give your approval for this and for the exact amount being blocked.

As soon as you have made the real payment – for example, when you check out of your hotel and use your credit card to pay for your room, or when you return your hire car and pay the final bill – the bank must immediately release the blocked amount from your credit card.  
Sample story
Blocked amounts must be released as soon as you pay

Boris from Hungary went to Venice for the weekend with his girlfriend. When they arrived at their hotel, the hotel took a copy of Boris' credit card. The hotel informed Boris that they would like to block EUR 500 to cover his reservation and any use of the mini-bar and restaurant services during their stay. Boris agreed to have his card blocked with this amount.

Before leaving the hotel, Boris paid his hotel bill using his credit card. A week later, when he tried to book some flights with his credit card, Boris realised that EUR 500 was still blocked on his credit card. He called the hotel to complain, who apologised for their mistake and immediately asked the bank to release the blocked amount.
Direct debits

If you have a direct debit set up from your bank account, it  may happen that a payment is made by mistake or the wrong amount is taken – for example if you cancelled a contract with a supplier, but the direct debit was still made after the contract was terminated. In these situations, you have the right to get a payment refunded within 8 weeks. This applies to all direct debits, both within your home country and cross-border direct debits within the EU.
What to do if you have a problem

If you have any problems making payments within the EU, you should contact your bank or card provider. They must give a written response to your complaint within 15 days (or up to 35 days in certain exceptional circumstances). They should also have a formal complaints procedure in place for consumers.

If you need any help getting your rights recognised, you can contact FIN-NET for problems with financial service providers, or ECC-Net for problems with traders.
Cheques

EU rules on bank charges for international and national payments do not apply to cheques.

There are sometimes very high transaction fees for cashing a cheque from another EU country. In many countries, cheques are also no longer accepted as a means of payment.

PSD2: the directive that will change banking as we know it
https://www.evry.com/en/news/articles/psd2-the-directive-that-will-change-banking-as-we-know-it/

It introduces two new types of players to the financial landscape: PISP and AISP.
AISP (Account Information Service Provider) are the service providers with 
access to the account information of bank customers. Such services could analyze
a user’s spending behavior or aggregate a user’s account information from 
several banks into one overview. PISP (Payment Initiation Service Provider) are
the service providers initiating a payment on behalf of the user. P2P transfer 
and bill payment are PISP services we are likely to see when PSD2 is implemented.
