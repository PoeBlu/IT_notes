@[https://www.aptitudesoftware.com/the-evolution-of-it-finance-architecture/]
  - CEOs and CFOs remain focused on driving business performance and 
    identifying opportunities to improve bottom line results. The right IT 
    finance architecture gives a company both the confidence to report how 
    the company makes money and the data-driven insights to make even more 
    money – so why are so many firms challenged to get the finance systems 
    that can give
    - Control over accounting
    - Data-centricity
    - Timeliness

- Creating a reliable, distributed ledger of exchange
@[https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/20/developing-a-global-financial-architecture/]
  - "People want to see that the money they send across borders is going where it is supposed to."
  - The movement of capital around the globe is of paramount importance to an 
    increasingly globalized society.
  - Compiling robust credit files and using unique identifiers.
  - You shouldn’t have to pay to use the money you already own.

<span xsmall>Financial instruments Classification</span>
@[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_instrument]
Main classification:
  * Cash instruments – instruments whose value is determined directly by 
    the markets @[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_(economics)]
    They can be securities @[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_(finance)],
    which are readily transferable, and instruments such as
  @[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loans] and
    deposits @[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deposit_(finance)], where both borrower 
    and lender have to agree on a transfer.
  
  * <a href="/wiki/Derivative_(finance)" title="Derivative (finance)">Derivative instruments</a> – 
    instruments which derive their value from the value and characteristics 
    of one or more underlying entities such as an <a href="/wiki/Asset" title="Asset">asset</a>,
    index, or <a href="/wiki/Interest_rate" title="Interest rate">interest rate</a>.
    They can be <a href="/wiki/Derivative_(finance)#OTC_and_exchange-traded" title="Derivative (finance)">exchange-traded derivatives</a> 
    and <a href="/wiki/Derivative_(finance)#OTC_and_exchange-traded" title="Derivative (finance)">over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives</a>.


Alternatively, financial instruments may be categorized by "asset class" 
depending on whether they are equity-based (reflecting <a href="/wiki/Ownership" title="Ownership">ownership</a>
of the issuing entity) or debt-based (reflecting a loan the investor has made to the issuing entity). 
If the instrument is debt, it can be further categorised into short-term (
less than one year) or long-term. Foreign exchange instruments and 
transactions are neither debt- nor equity-based and belong in their own category.

<span xsmall>Vocabulary</span>
  Risk_management:
  @[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_management]
  - identification, evaluation, and prioritization of risks (defined in ISO 
    31000 as the effect of uncertainty on objectives) followed by coordinated 
    and economical application of resources to minimize, monitor, and 
    control the probability or impact of unfortunate events[1] or to 
    maximize the realization of opportunities.
  - Treasury_management:
  @[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treasury_management]
  - includes management of an enterprise's holdings, with the ultimate goal 
  of managing the firm's liquidity and mitigating its operational, financial 
  and reputational risk. Treasury Management includes a firm's collections, 
  disbursements, concentration, investment and funding activities. In larger 
  firms, it may also include trading in bonds, currencies, financial 
  derivatives and the associated financial risk management. 
  - Financial_instrument:

<span xsmall>Understanding</span>
<span xsmall>Banking Comunication</span>
<span xsmall>(EBICS, Host-to-Host, SWIFT)</span>
@[https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/understanding-banking-communication-three-channels-ebics-gross]
Banking communication can be very complex and even confusing, especially when 
it comes to payments. Even people who work with payments on a daily basis 
often don?t understand the specific technical details behind them. After all, 
they are finance experts, working in accounting and treasury, and not payment 
technology experts. So how do we best determine the right setup for a 
company?

The three main channels
Which payment communication channels exist? Before you consider specific 
solutions or combinations for a company, you should take a closer look at 
what is actually available.

*EBICS*
EBICS is the German payments standard and is regulated by "Deutsche 
Kreditwirtschaft (DK)," a consortium made up of the Official Associations of 
a number of German bank types. It represents a very powerful combination of a 
standard channel and a standard format (SEPA, previously DTAUS). 
Communication is based on the TCP/IP Protocol. Authorized signatories are 
specified in the EBICS contracts and their signatures are called up for any 
communication with the banking server. Only once these signatures have been 
validated in connection with the type of instruction communicated at the same 
time (e.g. CCT for the SEPA DK format) does the banking server accept the 
file and log the result.

The back-ends of German banks are set up to meet the requirements of this 
communication method perfectly. All German banks use the EBICS standard, 
making it the most commonly used channel for payments within Germany.

*Host-to-host (H2H)*
A so-called host-to-host connection essentially represents a bilateral 
agreement between a company and a bank to exchange information. The bank 
defines the standard for the company. Generally, these connections are based 
on SFTP and HTTPS protocols that are already encrypted (SSH or SSL). However, 
some banks require additional file encryption with OpenPGP. There is a Single 
Point of Entry, i.e. a central interface, and the bank then forwards the 
information to their branches worldwide. The disadvantage of this solution is 
the lack of a clearly defined, common standard. Moreover, this solution is 
more complex to set up and requires more involvement by internal IT. The 
advantage is that the absence of regulation means no friction losses. Host-to-
host can be a very good solution for global payments, in particular if a 
company works with only a few main banks.

*SWIFT*
SWIFT is in a way a combination of EBICS and host-to-host. SWIFT has 
introduced SCORE (Standardised Corporate Environment), a clearly defined 
standard with clear rules for global payments. They specify in detail which 
financial messages may be exchanged by companies and financial institutes. A 
so-called SCORE Agreement needs to be drawn up; this is necessary but pretty 
straightforward. Once the agreement has been signed, corporates are 
authenticated in the SWIFT Network based on their company-own BIC. The 
infrastructure required for this is either supplied by a SaaS provider, a 
SWIFT Service Bureau or a local installation set up by internal IT. Unlike 
with EBICS and comparable to host-to-host, this means communicating globally 
with the banks? back-ends and forwarding files to the international branches. 
This solution makes sense if a company uses many different banks worldwide.

In reality, most companies use a combination of these solutions. The 
following example illustrates this: A company works with 20 banks in Germany 
and has therefore set up EBICS incl. SEPA. In addition, they have one main 
bank through which they process 70% of their global payments. For this, they 
use a host-to-host connection. For the remaining 30% of payments the company 
works with other global banks and has set up SWIFT to do so. Each company 
requires a detailed analysis of their banking landscape and needs to work out 
which volume of payments will make a host-to-host connection useful.

So why do many companies struggle to find the right payments solution? One of 
the problems is that quite often the only person they can turn to for advice 
is a member of the bank?s sales team. Here, they get information but they don?
t understand the technology behind the proposed solutions, and this makes it 
very difficult to form a neutral opinion. This is why it can make great sense 
to also talk to, for example, the provider of a treasury management system. 
The technology is there but companies need to make the best possible use of it
, and for this they require background information

<span xsmall>SWIFT Blockchain PoC</span>
@[https://www.blockchaindailynews.com/SWIFT-Blockchain-PoC-Final-Verdict-Back-office-Standardisation-prerequisite-for-DLT-adoption_a26324.html]
  In December 2017, I wrote about the SWIFT Blockchain Proof of concept (PoC
  ), and why I felt that the result was most likely going to be "DLT for 
  international payments processing is still work in progress ".
  SWIFT finally released the results of the PoC this month and have confirmed 
  that there is a lot more work needed within Banks' back office technology 
  and operational processes for DLT to be relevant.
  The PoC was aimed at international payments and how intraday/real time 
  liquidity management could be performed using DLT. Correspondent banks 
  provide services on behalf of another overseas financial institution 
  through a correspondent account (Nostro/ Vostro account). However, about 34%
  of the cost of an international payment is related to Nostro trapped 
  liquidity. This is due to the lack of real-time data to optimize intraday 
  liquidity management.
  Managing Nostro accounts and ensuring there is no over funding or overusage 
  of credit lines depend on availability of real time data. A real-time feed 
  of transaction data would allow banks to release payments to customers 
  quicker, whilst reducing liquidity risks.
  With that as the driver behind the initiative, a consortium of 34 banks 
  worked on this use case with SWIFT. In Q1 2017 SWIFT had launched their 
  Global Payments Initiative (GPI) with these banks and it went live without 
  DLT. SWIFT wanted to get their product out using legacy systems, and not 
  wait for the results of the DLT prototype.

  The results of the DLT prototype are as follows:
  | Nostro DLT application, combined with the ISO 20022 data model, delivered the 
  | business functionalities and data richness required for automated real-time 
  | liquidity monitoring and reconciliation. Real-time confirmation of each account
  | entry and use of the unique end-to-end transaction reference (UETR) - SWIFT's 
  | central payments tracker, made it possible.
  | 
  | Further progress is needed on DLT technology before it is ready to support 
  | applications in large scale critical global infrastructures. 528 channels were 
  | required in the PoC to ensure Nostro accounts would only be stored on the nodes
  |  of their account servicers and owners. But when the solution is in production,
  |  more than 100,000 such channels would need to be defined. DLT solution hasn't 
  | matured yet to handle that load
  | 
  | All Nostro Account service providers will need to migrate their back-office liq
  | uidity reporting process from Batch to real time processing. ISO 20022, will ne
  | ed to be applied across banks to ensure data shared across different banks has 
  | consistent data elements. Such a common data model is essential to reduce integ
  | ration costs (between SWIFT and the banks).
  | 
  | We will continue our R&D efforts to ensure that SWIFT customers will be able to
  |  leverage their existing SWIFT infrastructure and connectivity to benefit from 
  | blockchain services, whether offered by SWIFT or by third parties, on a secure 
  | and trusted platform.
  | Stephen Gilderdale, Chief Platform Officer, SWIFT
  | 
  | While the existing GPI has been successful for SWIFT, for the GPI to use DLT, i
  | t requires all banks to have a real time infrastructure. SWIFT is currently foc
  | used on helping that transformation happen.
  | Adoption of ISO 20022 is a pre-requisite to save costs before DLT can be beta t
  | ested for wider adoption. As this progresses, SWIFT will continue to explore ad
  | vancements within the DLT space to ensure there are no non-functional performan
  | ce/scaling challenges.
  | I see this as a major setback for banks' adoption of Blockchain. If banks' back
  |  office processes and technologies need to be transformed before DLT can be use
  | d, we may have to wait for a good part of another decade.
  | The official press release mentions that it is a question of "when rather than 
  | an if" for DLT to be used in this context. However, I believe that is a gross u
  | nderestimation of banks' inability to transform their back office technology an
  | d operational processes.

The Financial Information eXchange (FIX) protocol is an electronic communications
protocol initiated in 1992 for international real-time exchange of information 
related to the securities transactions and markets. With trillions of dollars 
traded annually on the NASDAQ alone, financial service entities are investing 
heavily in optimizing electronic trading and employing direct market access (DMA)
 to increase their speed to financial markets. Managing the delivery of trading
applications and keeping latency low increasingly requires an understanding of 
the FIX protocol.

S4 (Applicability Statement 4) is a Conformance Profile of the OASIS ebMS 3.0 
specification,[1] and represents an open standard for the secure and payload-agnostic
exchange of Business-to-business documents using Web services. Secure document 
exchange is governed by aspects of WS-Security, including XML Encryption and 
XML Digital Signatures. Payload agnosticism refers to the document type (e.g. 
purchase order, invoice, etc.) not being tied to any defined SOAP action or 
operation.

AS4 became a standard in 2013.[2] The majority of the AS4 profiling points 
constraining the ebMS 3.0 specification are based upon the functional 
requirements of the AS2 specification. By scaling back ebMS 3.0 using AS2 as 
a blueprint, AS4 provides an entry-level on-ramp for Web services B2B by 
simplifying the complexities of Web services.[clarification needed]

Key Technical Highlights

    Support for SOAP 1.1 and 1.2 enveloping structure
    Payload agnosticism
    Support for single or multiple payloads contained either within the SOAP 
        body or as SOAP attachment(s)
    Support for payload compression
    Support for message-level security including various combinations of XML 
        Digital Signature and/or XML Encryption
    Support for X.509 security tokens and username/password tokens
    Support for business receipt of non-repudiation similar to the Message 
        Disposition Notification (MDN)[3] used by AS2 and specified as an XML 
        schema by the ebXML BPSS group
    Support for the ebMS 3.0 One-Way/Push message exchange pattern with support
        for either synchronous or asynchronous responses
    Support for the ebMS 3.0 One-Way/Pull message exchange pattern which is

-fast and secure off-line contactless transaction
@[https://projects.eclipse.org/proposals/eclipse-keyple]

Calypso is a set of specifications describing a fast and secure off-line 
contactless transaction, between a portable object and a terminal. It has 
been created at the end of the 1990s by some european public transport 
operators or authority (RATP and SNCF in Paris and all France, STIB in 
Brussels, OTLIS in Lisbon, ACTV in Venice, Konstanz in Germany), in order to 
create an open , interoperable and secure standard independent from 
industrials to ensure a real competition.

Today Calypso represent 20% of the world market of contactless smart 
ticketing in 25 countries and 125 cities. It brings to his user a guarantee 
of security and interoperability which relies on a total compliance with 
existing standards  (ISO 14443, ISO 7816-4, Global Platform). The Calypso 
standard is managed by the Calypso Networks Association (CNA) , which is led 
by transports operators and public authorities in order to ensure openness 
and independence from industrials in confront of other proprietary schemes.

The openness for a contactless ticketing standard can be evaluated for the 
two mains components of ticketing systems, with the complementary concern 
about guarantee of security:

    Cards and portable objects (mobile phones, Java objects, wearables, …)
    Terminals (validators, vending equipment, …)

Europe GDP settled every 5 days.

TARGET2 is based on a technically centralised platform ? the SSP ? and all 
users, irrespective of their location, have access to the same services, 
functionalities and inter faces at the same price.

The SSP of TARGET2 was set up using a modular approach. Every module in the 
SSP is closely related to a specific service (e.g. the Payments Module for 
the processing of payments). Some of the modules (Home Accounting, Standing 
Facilities and Reserve Management Modules) can be used by individual central 
banks on an optional basis. Central banks that do not use these modules offer 
the respective services via proprietary applications in their domestic 
technical environments.  SWIFT standards and services (e.g. FIN, InterAct, 
FileAct and Browse) are used to enable standardised communication between the 
TARGET2 system and its participants. Since November 2010 TARGET2 has also 
offered internet-based access for low-volume participants 

FROM http://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/t2/shared/pdf/professionals/release_12/Communication_for_the_SSP_release_12_0_1st_User_consultation.pdf 

- it might be necessary to connect TARGET2 to TARGET Instant Payment Settlement
(TIPS) if the implementation of TIPS (currently under investigation) is 
confirmed by the Governing Council. 
One more, although minor, amendment of TARGET2  already foreseen for release 
12.0 is the update of the SWIFT standard for BICs 
(update of ISO 9362standard)?
TIPS: TARGET instant payment settlement (TIPS)
New service for the settlement of instant payments, enabling payment service 
providers to offer fund transfers in real time and around the clock, 365 days 
a year.
Instant payments will increase the speed of euro payments in the European 
Union. Today it takes up to one business day for a payment in euro to reach 
the beneficiary . 
With instant payments, the funds will be available immediately for use by the 
recipient, 24/7/365.
From an end-user perspective, the benefit of instant payments is the ability 
to make time-sensitive payments immediately, wherever and whenever necessary. 
The implementation of instant payments may also provide the basis for service 
enhancements and value-added services, e.g. person-to-person mobile 
payments.
Payment service providers are encouraged to make instant payment solutions in 
euro available at a pan-European level as of November 2017. Although it is 
not mandatory for payment service providers to offer SCTinst, it is expected 
that a large number of them will do so.
The TIPS pricing policy will favour reachability. The entry and maintenance 
fees for an account in TIPS will be set at zero. The charges to be paid per 
transaction will be proportional to the volume of instant payments processed 
via TIPS in order to comply with our full cost recovery principle. In this 
context, the feedback on expected volumes in the market consultation was very 
encouraging. It exceeded the volumes initially estimated by the Eurosystem 
both as regards total market volumes and the volumes that market participants 
would expect to process in TIPS. The Eurosystem will offer the service to 
banks at the price of a maximum of 0.20 eurocent (?0.0020) per payment for at 
least the first two years of operation.

<a xsmall href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/consumers/financial-products-and-services/payments-transfers-cheques/index_en.htm">EU Payments, transfers and cheques</a>
When you make a cross-border payment in euros, Romanian lei and Swedish krona within the EU, your bank can't charge you more than it would for an equivalent national transaction. Even banks based in EU countries outside the euro area must apply this rule.

This includes any:

    transfers between bank accounts in different EU countries
    withdrawals from cash machines/ATMs in EU countries
    payments by debit or credit card across the EU
    direct debit transactions

For example, if your bank charges you 1 EUR each time you withdraw money in your home country from a cash machine outside your bank network, they can charge you the same amount when you make a withdrawal in another EU country.
Charges for using your card

When you pay for something in the EU using your credit or debit card, traders and banks cannot charge you an extra fee – also known as "surcharging" – just for using a particular card. This rule applies to all card purchases (in shops and online) made within your home country or in another EU country.

American Express, Diners Club, and business or corporate credit cards, where your employer is billed instead of you, are not covered by EU rules on payment services, and you can still be charged extra for using these cards.

You should be aware that if you're paying in EU currencies other than euros, you may still be charged a currency conversion fee by your card provider when you use your card in another country.
Sample story
You shouldn't be charged extra for using your card

Clara from Austria wanted to buy flight tickets online. She selected her tickets on the airline's website and went to pay. However, when she entered her credit card information, the airline added an extra EUR 10 to the cost of her order as a charge for using a VISA card.

Clara contacted her local European Consumer Centre, who raised a complaint with the airline. The airline refunded the EUR 10 charge for her booking, and modified their rules to remove the illegal surcharge from their booking process.
Card and payment fraud

EU rules limit the amount you can be asked to pay if you're the victim of card or payment fraud – where your card or your account is debited without your permission. In all cases, you can only be asked to pay a maximum of EUR 50 towards the cost of the fraudulent payments.

However, in cases where you were unaware of the loss, theft or misappropriation of funds (i.e. your account was hacked, or your card was cloned and charged without your knowledge), then you don't have to pay anything. Your bank or card provider should cover all the costs. This rule also applies if the loss was caused by a bank employee.
Blocked money on your card

Sometimes when you make a reservation, such as a hotel booking or car rental, you may be asked to give your card details to guarantee your booking. The trader may also ask to block a certain amount of money on your card when you make your reservation. This means  the trader reserves part of your credit limit or account balance  to cover any charge they expect you to build up, such as room service in a hotel, or possible damage to a hire car.

You should be informed by the trader if they intend to block an amount on your credit card, and you must give your approval for this and for the exact amount being blocked.

As soon as you have made the real payment – for example, when you check out of your hotel and use your credit card to pay for your room, or when you return your hire car and pay the final bill – the bank must immediately release the blocked amount from your credit card.  
Sample story
Blocked amounts must be released as soon as you pay

Boris from Hungary went to Venice for the weekend with his girlfriend. When they arrived at their hotel, the hotel took a copy of Boris' credit card. The hotel informed Boris that they would like to block EUR 500 to cover his reservation and any use of the mini-bar and restaurant services during their stay. Boris agreed to have his card blocked with this amount.

Before leaving the hotel, Boris paid his hotel bill using his credit card. A week later, when he tried to book some flights with his credit card, Boris realised that EUR 500 was still blocked on his credit card. He called the hotel to complain, who apologised for their mistake and immediately asked the bank to release the blocked amount.
Direct debits

If you have a direct debit set up from your bank account, it  may happen that a payment is made by mistake or the wrong amount is taken – for example if you cancelled a contract with a supplier, but the direct debit was still made after the contract was terminated. In these situations, you have the right to get a payment refunded within 8 weeks. This applies to all direct debits, both within your home country and cross-border direct debits within the EU.
What to do if you have a problem

If you have any problems making payments within the EU, you should contact your bank or card provider. They must give a written response to your complaint within 15 days (or up to 35 days in certain exceptional circumstances). They should also have a formal complaints procedure in place for consumers.

If you need any help getting your rights recognised, you can contact FIN-NET for problems with financial service providers, or ECC-Net for problems with traders.
Cheques

EU rules on bank charges for international and national payments do not apply to cheques.

There are sometimes very high transaction fees for cashing a cheque from another EU country. In many countries, cheques are also no longer accepted as a means of payment.

LMAX aims to be the fastest trading platform in the world. Clearly, in order 
to achieve this we needed to do something special to achieve very low-latency 
and high-throughput with our Java platform. Performance testing showed that 
using queues to pass data between stages of the system was introducing latency
, so we focused on optimising this area

The Disruptor is the result of our research and testing. We found that cache 
misses at the CPU-level, and locks requiring kernel arbitration are both 
extremely costly, so we created a framework which has "mechanical sympathy" 
for the hardware it's running on, and that's lock-free.

<span xsmall>LexiFi's</span>
<span xsmall>Modeling Language</span>
<span xsmall>for Finance</span>

Developed by the company LexiFi, the Modeling Language for Finance (MLFi) is 
the first formal language that accurately describes the most sophisticated 
capital market, credit, and investment products. MLFi is implemented as an 
extension of OCaml.

MLFi users derive two important benefits from a functional programming 
approach. First, the declarative formalism of functional programming 
languages is well suited for specifying complex data structures and algorithms
. Second, functional programming languages have strong list processing 
capabilities. Lists play a central role in finance where they are used 
extensively to define contract event and payment schedules.

In addition, MLFi provides crucial business integration capabilities 
inherited from OCaml and related tools and libraries. This enables users, for 
example, to interoperate with C and Java programs, manipulate XML schemas and 
documents, and interface with SQL databases.

Data models and object models aiming to encapsulate the definitions and 
behavior of financial instruments were developed by the banking industry over 
the past two decades, but face inherent limitations that OCaml helped 
overcome.

LexiFi's approach to modeling complex financial contracts received an 
academic award in 2000, and the MLFi implementation was elected “Software 
Product of the Year 2001” by the magazine Risk, the leading financial trading 
and risk management publication. MLFi-based solutions are gaining growing 
acceptance throughout Europe and are contributing to spread the use of OCaml 
in the financial services industry

use of payment cards, such as debit or credit cards, at payment terminals 
located at points of sale. EFTPOS technology originated in the United States 
in 1981 and was adopted by other countries. In Australia and New Zealand, it 
is also the brand name of a specific system used for such payments; these 
systems are mainly country specific and do not interconnect.

Debit and credit cards are embossed plastic cards complying with ISO/IEC 7810 
ID-1 standard. The cards have an embossed bank card number conforming with 
the ISO/IEC 7812 numbering standard.

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basel_Accords">Basel Accords</a>
Target: minimize the debt of financial entities and guarantee their capacity 
        to react against operational, credit and market risks.

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basel_I">Basel I (1988)</a>
Basel_I:
  Estableció unos principios básicos en los que debía fundamentarse la actividad 
bancaria como el capital regulatorio, requisito de permanencia, capacidad de 
absorción de pérdidas y de protección ante quiebra. Este capital debía ser
suficiente para hacer frente a los riesgos de crédito, mercado y tipo de cambio.

  El acuerdo establecía también que el capital mínimo de la entidad bancaria debía
ser el 8% del total de los activos de riesgo (crédito, mercado y tipo de cambio 
sumados).

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basel_II">Basel I (2004):</a>
 Desarrolla de manera más extensa el cálculo de los activos ponderados
por riesgo y permitía que las entidades bancarias aplicaran calificaciones
de riesgo basadas en sus modelos internos, siempre que estuviesen 
previamente aprobadas por el supervisor. 

 Este acuerdo incorporaba, por lo tanto, nuevas tendencias en la medición
y el seguimiento de las distintas clases de riesgo. Se hizo énfasis en
metodologías internas, revisión de la supervisión y disciplina de mercado.

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basel_III">Basel I (2010):</a>
  Intentó adaptarse a la magnitud de la crisis económica, atendiendo
a la exposición de gran parte de los bancos de todo el mundo a los
"activos tóxicos" en los balances de los bancos y en los derivados que
circulaban en el mercado. 
  El temor al efecto dominó que pudiera causar la insolvencia de los bancos,
hizo que se establecieron nuevas recomendaciones como:

  - Endurecimiento de los criterios y aumento de la calidad del volumen de
    capital para asegurar su mayor capacidad para absorber pérdidas.

  - Modificación de los criterios de cálculo de los riesgos para disminuir
    el nivel de exposición real.

  - Constitución de colchones de capital durante los buenos tiempos que 
    permitan hacer frente el cambio de ciclo económico. 

  - Introducción de un nuevo ratio de apalancamiento como medida complementaria 
    al ratio de solvencia.

<a href="https://blog.powerdata.es/el-valor-de-la-gestion-de-datos/bid/307135/La-gesti-n-de-metadatos-en-los-Acuerdos-de-Basilea">La gestión de metadatos en los Acuerdos de Basilea:</a>
  El requerimiento de transparencia de los Acuerdos de Basilea y la necesidad de
justificar un valor a auditores externos hace necesaria la capacidad de rastrear
la información con precisión y por eso proponemos la reutilización de los metadatos
de la organización o la implementación de nuevos metadatos para evitar posibles
retrasos en el día a día de la organización cada vez que haya que recabar información
para explicar un valor.

Basilea II establece las condiciones mínimas que una entidad bancaria debe tener 
para asegurar su estabilidad en un ecosistema económico mundial.

Aparte de satisfacer S10-6 (Basel Supervisory), una buena Gestión de Metadatos permite
analizar el curso de los datos en vertical y en horizontal desde la fuente, pasando
por las funciones de transformación hasta el informe en la capa de Reporting

Otro de los beneficios de la gestión de metadatos es la capacidad de hacer análisis
de impacto de forma automática. Esto supone la capacidad de ver cómo impacta un
cambio en el ecosistema de aplicaciones. Por ejemplo, un cambio en los datos de un
cliente en una aplicación front-end pueden ocasionar un conflicto con los contratos
o los procesos asociados a ese mismo cliente en otra aplicación de back-office y
eso podría generar inconsistencias operacionales, descuadres e incidencias serias en la 
capa de reporting.

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BCBS_239">BCBS 239</a>
 Basel Committee on Banking Supervision's standard number 239. 
The subject title of the standard is: "Principles for effective risk data 
aggregation and risk reporting". The overall objective of the standard is to 
strengthen banks’ risk data aggregation capabilities and internal risk 
reporting practices, in turn, enhancing the risk management and decision 
making processes at banks.[1]

What is PCI level 1 compliance and why do you need to know?

If you sell anything online - or even just follow the news related to recent credit card fraud - you’re probably aware that there are standards governing online payments. When those standards are violated, massive opportunities for fraud can occur. As an online merchant, it is critical to take measures to protect customer card data. The success of your business depends on it.

Fortunately, there’s a set of established rules to protect customer card data. It is called the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), and it is governed by the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council (PCI SSC). These rules are better known in our business vernacular as PCI compliance.

Goldman Sachs has launched three of its latest open source projects – 
- Jrpip 
Jrpip implements remote interface method invocation which allows different 
Java processes to interact with one another. The product was designed to 
increase developer efficiency by providing useful features, such as the ability to deploy in any servlet container, interface implementation that doesn’t require RemoteException and automatic retries with once-execute semantics. Additionally, Jrpip uses an efficient binary protocol that is streamed, reducing memory consumption and garbage collector issues. “We hope the open source community finds Jrpip to be a useful Java library,” said Mohammad, a vice president and technology fellow in the Technology Division. “With Jrpip, the developers can concentrate on their code instead of worrying about network plumbing and TCP errors.”
- Obevo
Obevo is a database deployment tool that helps teams manage database changes in their Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) process. In addition to handling production deployments, Obevo aids the development phase by defining a clean structure to maintain DB object code, and helps the testing phase with features such as in-memory database conversion. Notably, Obevo was designed for systems of enterprise scale and complexity and can manage hundreds of DB objects in a schema, while still handling new schemas in a simple manner. “We feel our ability to onboard a large and long-lived system to a clean SDLC process is a key differentiator in the open source space,” said Shant, a vice president in the Technology Division. “By publishing this to the open source community, we hope to aid others in their own DB deployment estates while growing a strong community around the tool.”


- Tablasco 

Tablasco is a JUnit rule that adds table verification to unit tests. For software products that produce large amounts of data, this tool can help to create automated tests that are both comprehensive and easy to maintain. Users only need to adapt their existing data to a table format that Tablasco understands. “Every test produces a color-coded HTML break report, which helps users quickly identify the issue,” said Barry, a vice president in the Technology Division. Furthermore, Tablasco features automated baseline management, allowing users to easily update the baseline file of a failing test.

@[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Business_Language]
Universal Business Language (UBL) is an open library of standard 
electronic XML business documents for procurement and 
transportation such as purchase orders, invoices, transport 
logistics and waybills. UBL was developed by an OASIS Technical 
Committee with participation from a variety of industry data 
standards organizations. UBL is designed to plug directly into 
existing business, legal, auditing, and records management practices
.[1] It is designed to eliminate the re-keying of data in existing 
fax- and paper-based business correspondence and provide an entry 
point into electronic commerce for small and medium-sized businesses.
