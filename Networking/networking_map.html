OReilly Courses: Leveraging multiplatform DNS for web application resiliency,Sponsored by Oracle Dyn, Instructor Matt Torrisi
    What you'll learn Instructor Schedule
    
       The threat to an organization?s DNS has never been more pronounced, and 
the operations community is furiously working to protect against attacks and other
types of service disruptions. The most obvious way to increase DNS resiliency 
comes through having multiple providers. However, this isn?t as simple as adding
a secondary or alternate DNS service. As service disruptions become increasingly
prevalent, your management of multiple DNS instances must become more sophisticated.
 Understanding how multiple vendors and systems can work in unison rather than 
creating silos or reducing strategic capabilities?is pivotal to effective asset management.
    
Join Matt Torrisi to learn how to implement multiplatform DNS. Along the way, Matt covers 
the important criteria in assessing DNS network compatibility and demonstrates how
to use DNS as a traffic-steering platform. You'll also create an optimized traffic
flow diagram for your organization's domain so you can communicate the concepts you've
learned in this session with your own team.

By the end of this course, you'll understand:
  - How traffic is decided on multiplatform DNS delegations during normal operation and during failure states
  - Important criteria in assessing DNS network compatibility
  - How to use DNS as a traffic-steering platform for higher-level traffic
    
And you'll be able to:
  - Articulate the high-level narrative of multivendor DNS and why it is important for domain resilience
  - Identify areas of risk for domain resolution
  - Apply DNS traffic patterns to enable scalable multivendor DNS solutions with even the tallest zones and most complex traffic-steering solutions
  - Deploy DNS with confidence across multiple platforms
    
  You want to understand how to craft scalable traffic flows for your domains that utilize GSLB.
  You're responsible for an enterprise solution using a single DNS solution, and you want 
     to understand how to build redundancy into your delegation.
   
Prerequisites
  A working knowledge of authoritative DNS
    
Required materials and setup:
   An exported zone file to use for the hands-on exercise (Be sure you have some understanding
   of the critical hosts within it, especially if those hosts already have traffic steering
   functionality in the current environment.)
    
Lecture: The importance of DNS to both traditional and cloud-native organizations; 
. anatomy of a DNS query and response
    
Lecture: Secondary DNS isn't just a backup. The case for multiple DNS platforms;
    using zone file management to keep multiple vendors in sync; the pros and cons of 
    including internal NS in a public delegation; vendor evaluation criteria for inclusion 
    in a long-term multivendor DNS strategy
    
   
Lecture: Using DNS for traffic steering.  capabilities and caveats; using management zones
    to move traffic steering capabilities off a zone; a comparison of centralized management
    zones and cuts in authority; keeping response behavior equal across multiple providers
    with proprietary solutions; introduction to tool-based orchestration and common libraries
    
    Optimizing your zone file for multiplatform DNS (30 minutes)
    
   Hands-on exercise: Take one of your own zones and apply the management zone techniques to 
  develop a draft traffic steering flow in a multilayer, multiplatform environment
