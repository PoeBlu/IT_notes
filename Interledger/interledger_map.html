  <ol>
    <li>Interledger as a SETTLEMENT System (ORIGINAL VIEW) <br/>
      <ul>
        <li>ILP cryptography support on settlement ledgers.</li>
        <li>Ledgers will have support for conditional transfers and are fast enough.</li>
        <li>Trust-lines are an unusual type of ledger.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Interledger as a CLEARING System (CURRENT VIEW September 2017+)<br/>
      <ul>
        <li>connectors as central actors acting as "clearing houses"</li>
        <li>NORMAL CASE: connectors have some credit/trustlines relationship with each other. ILP payments go through them</li>
        <li>UNUSUAL CASE:  You send every transfer through some ledger</li>
        <li>ILP: try to standardize the clearing protocol<br/>
           entitities needed by connectors to clear payments: [transfers, fulfillments, rejections, quotes, route broadcasts]<br/>
           <b>"""settle is completely divorced from clearing payments""".</b>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The Internet *WITH* VALUE (FUTURISTIC VIEW) <br/> 
      <ul>
        <li>LAYER 0: ability to send paid paquests(requests), and conditionally paid paquets(requests)</li>
        <li>LAYER 1: ILP Address namespace to route packets</li>
        <li>LAYER 2: Data on top of ILP. Ability to send/receive paid data by just connecting to the ILP network.
            (Stream services, PaaS, ....)</li>
        <li><span cite> (Evan Schwartz)"""...An argument here is that the reason IPv6 didn't really take off
         was because it offered relatively minor improvements over IPv4. In contrast, ILP introduces the ability
         to send value as well as information and the ILP Addresses are much more flexible even than IPv6 addresses."""</span>

  Triple entry accountancy</a> </span><br/>
  Use of cryptographic techniques to anotate a payment or transfer.
 A cryptographic probe is used next to each transfer or ledger annotation
to provide NON-repudiable fact that a payment was initiated by 
sender and confirmed by receiver.<br/>
  It's mostly relevant for distributed transactions between 
different ledgers (data bases) controlled by different organizations
with minimal trust amongst them.<br/>
<span xbig>Cryptrographic annotations are non-repudiable</span>:<br/>
 Anyone involved has a "legal" probe that anyone else has executed 
or rejected the payment. <br/>
<ul>
  <li>In many scenarios the cryptographic probe just avoids any dispute 
(the algorithm does not allow for different states -blockchain).</li>
  <li>In others it helps to quickly identify who is wrong.
("I know it, you know it, I know that you know it, You know that I know that
 you know it, ...)</li>

  <ul>
    <li>Every ledger or blockchain account is asigned a "mostly unique"<code>ILP Address</code>.<br/>
        Since there is no central authority goberning ILP address asignation collision between ILP addresses is
        possible but that collision will be detected soon since payments are also protected by sha256 hashes.
        (An ILP payment arriving to wrong recipients will not match the pre-acorded sha256 hash)
    </li>
    <li>ILP addresses provide a mechanism to route payments to their intended destination through a 
        recursive series of ILP network nodes</li>
    <li><code>Destination Addresses</code> are complete addresses that can receive payments, always mapping to
        one account in a ledger</li>
    <li><code>Addresses Prefixes</code> are INcomplete addresses representing a group of destination addresses,
        or a connector node</li>

  <span xbig>Trust-lines / Payment Channels</span>
  <ul>
    <li>Trust-line: Virtual ledger established amongst peers that keeps a
      temporal balance that periodically gets sincronised with the (real)
      settlement ledger<br/>
      Trus-lines can be divided into:
      <ul>
        <li>asymmetrical trustline: ledger with two account holders,
          and one of them is also the ledger administrator.</li>
        <li> symmetrical trustline: ledger with two account holders,
          who collaborate on an equal basis to administer the 
          ledger between them.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Payment-channel: A trust-line with the support of 
      a blockchain or cryptographic system to secure/enhance
      payments.<br/>
      Lightning and <a href="https://ripple.com/build/payment-channels-tutorial/">
      Ripple XPR Channels</a> are two well known examples.<br/>
      More info and theory about them can also be found in the

  <ul>
    <li>standardized identifier for accounts that can <b>RECEIVE</b> payments.<br/>
    <li>A payment pointer can be resolved to an "https" URL that provides
       the location of a payment setup service endpoint
       (previous step to payment)</li>
    <li>(design goal): It's used for (pre)payment setup protocols BUT 
        it should be possible for any new payment setup protocol to "reuse"
        payment pointers.</li>
    <li>
      <p>The syntax of a payment pointer is (ABNF):
<pre { >
  "$" host path-abempty
</pre }>
      The corresponding URL will be
<pre { >
  "$" host path-abempty 
(empty path-abempty is replaced by <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/well-known-uris/well-known-uris.xhtml">/well-known</a>/pay)

      If the fulfillment arrives to connector2 it will execute pending on-hold money from connector1, but since the fulfillment arrives late to connector1, both sender and connector1 (that were waiting for up to a timeout for the fulfillment response) will rollback. Sender gets its money back but connector1, that was already paid to connector2, is not rewarded and looses money.

     <p cite>....we haven't abandoned the ideal insofar ...
         we still want any many payments as possible to be atomic ...
         we cannot assume that atomic mode will always be available.<br/>
         ... all participants along the payment chain have to have full
         unconditional trust in the notary ... in order to be able to use
         atomic mode all of the time, there must be at least one notary that 
         is trusted by all people in the world. Otherwise, we may
         run into situations where a liquidity path is available, but no valid
         notary can be selected.<br/>
         
         It is possible to use multiple notaries in a payment, but that actually
         doesn't make the trust problem easier and arguably makes it harder... 
         then we now need all participants to trust notaries such that none 
         of the notaries they trust would ever collude with any other notary they trust.
         <br/>
         ...
         <b>It is possible to use atomic mode in the context of a universal mode
         payment. Any number of participants can decide to make the transfer between
         them subsidiary to some notary. If all the participants do that,
         congratulations, the payment is fully atomic.<br/>
         
         SO THE IDEA IS TO DEFAULT TO UNIVERSAL MODE AND USE ATOMIC WHERE POSSIBLE
         </b>
         
         Ripple is currently building a proprietary network for banks that uses
         atomic mode internally and universal mode externally.<br/>
         
         ...XRP Atomic Mode Autodetection (XAMA). The idea is to allow participants in 
         a payment to detect that XRP is used as one of the hops and then defer to
         the outcome of the XRP transaction instead of using their own timeouts, 
         effectively making the XRP Ledger a de-facto notary.
          This can be generalized as a defer-right and defer-left behavior.
          Any neighboring pair of participants (:= sender|receiver|connector) can
         - by mutual agreement - decide to defer the outcome of their
         transfer to whatever the outcome on the ledger right of them or the ledger
         left of them.<br/>

In my experience to date, it's most often people familiar with existing
payment systems that want atomic mode. I think that in time <b>we'll find that
complete end to end atomicity comes at a cost that is not justified for a
lot of payments.</b><br/>

<b>... There are operational costs that must be covered but ... the cost to 
move the bytes from A to B to make a payment is certainly nowhere
near the 1% and up that most payments cost to send.</b><br/>

<b>In a world where ILP is a foundational layer ...  it's still possible
 for someone to send a payment at almost zero cost if they accept the 
 associated risks.</b>

<div xxsmall>
<p> Ledger layer components don't have to understand ILP unless they choose to
re-use the condition for their own local transfer. Ledgers themselves
*never* have to understand ILP.</p>

<p>Remember a ledger layer protocol could use a completely different
conditional payments scheme, like atomic mode ILP, where it takes the
end-to-end condition and creates a new compound condition that depends on
the fulfillment and some notary signature.</p>

          ... I guess the advantage of HTTP is that it's easier (to implement).
          The Advantage of WebSockets is that it allows a client (so a computer 
          that's not publicly addressable, e.g. a laptop or phone) to be a receiver,
          and that some JavaScript-based connectors may only support WebSockets 
          (but if a JavaScript-based connector wants to peer with a Java-based one,
           it would be easy to add ilp-plugin-http)"""

        <span cite>
          <p>In the readme, we should explain that this plugin implements "BTP/2.0"
            (if that's what we want to call it), and is 
          <a href="https://github.com/interledgerjs/ilp-plugin-btp/blob/master/index.js#L343">incompatible</a> with BTP/1.0.
          </p>
          <p>
          Also, we need to explicitly document (since it's so confusing) that the new 
          Transfer/Response/Error sequence <strong>decreases</strong> (settles) the 
          sender's <code>unsecuredAmount</code>.
           This is the opposite of how in BTP/1.0 the Prepare/Fulfill/Reject sequence
          used to <strong>increase</strong> (cause) the sender's <code>unsecuredAmount</code>,<br>
          see <a href="https://github.com/interledger/rfcs/pull/360#issuecomment-355737129">interledger/rfcs#360 (comment)</a>.<br/>
           It would be easy to oversee this difference, and think that Transfer/Response/Error is just the unconditional version 
          of Prepare/Fulfill/Reject. Or maybe we should just say "forget everything you think you know about BTP". :)

           the two parties trust one another (up to a limit) for funds that have not yet been settled on the underlying ledger.
           If their trust limit is high enough, the two parties can transact without settling on an underlying ledger at all."""<br/>

      <li>glossary:
        <ul>
          <li>**BTP Connection**: websocket connection over which BTP packets are
            sent. Websockets (as opposed to raw TLS sockets) are used because they provide
            message framing and can be used from the browser.
          </li>
          <li>**BTP Packets**: protocol data units formally defined in ASN.1</li>
          <li>**Peers** are the parties on a BTP connection. Your peer is the party on the
              other side of the BTP connection.</li>
          <li>**Bilateral Ledger**: (not to be confused with the **Underlying (settlement) Ledger**)
              ledger which the peers on a BTP connection are keeping track of.
              When a peer keeping Authoritative State receives a BTP
              packet, they process it and adjust their copy of the bilateral ledger.
          </li>
          <li>**Authoritative State**: authoritative view of the Bilateral Ledger's
          state, maintained by one (one peer must the other ) or both of the peers
          (they can get into dispute due to timeouts+race-conditions)</li>
          <li>**request is In-Flight**: if the request has been sent out, but no response has been sent yet</li>
          <li>**transfer is In-Flight**: if it has been prepared but not yet fulfilled nor rejected</li>
          <li>**Underlying Ledger**: moves value between the two peers when they settle their balance</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>BTP Sub-protocols include optional functionality like ledger
          metadata, balance, automated settlement, and dispute resolution.<br/>

     Before starting an ILP payment senders ("wallets") needs to know the destination ILP address and
     the amount. SPSP is one high-level protocol used for that purpose.
     <ul>
       <li>Simple Payment Setup Protocol to create "input" condition to initiate an ILP payment.</li>
       <li>The flow of payment can be similar to:
<pre>
client -> webshop: browse catalog and click on pay
webshop -> client: SPSP payment pointer
client <-> payment pointer: Agree payment-data:
            [ILP destination address , amount]
-- ILP Payment --
client -> local connector: sendData(payment-data)
...
client &lt;- local connector: fulfillment (payment receipt) OR ILP error
</pre>
      </li>
       <li>SPSP may be used by end-user applications, such as a digital wallet with a user interface 
           for the sender to initiate payments.</li>
       <li>SPSP is NOT enforced and other protocols and/or procedures can be used</li>
       </li>
       <li>Any SPSP receiver will run an SPSP server and expose an HTTPS endpoint called the SPSP payment pointer.</li>
       <li>SPSP uses the Pre-Shared Key v2(PSK2) transport protocol for condition generation and data encoding</li>
       <li>SPSP ussually is "good enough" because the payment sender can present the
         fulfillment to connectors to probe that the payment was recieved by the recipient even 
         if it wasn't ... but he will not win much with that. He will just loose his money  
         The receiver can not probe the opposite but he just received money for free.<br/>
         <br/>
         IPR is just needed in some "corner" scenarios when the receiver could be fined 
         because un-intentionally he received the money and he was obligated
         to declare the error to some authority. 
         IPR is "slightly" safer, 100% non-repudiable, but takes more message rounds 
         between sender and receiver and so it less suitable for small payments.

    Framework for creating payment-channel based ILP ledger plugins,

      """Any ledger protocol author can definitely fork BTP, or 
         design something completely different from scratch.<br/>
         However, as we've found writing ledger plugins, it's much easier to
         use something like the payment channel framework than implement everything
         yourself. That framework will be changed to use the BTP as the base protocol
         and allow individual plugins to add custom messages (in the same way you can
         add custom RPC methods now) and custom data to existing messages (in the same
         way you can add custom arguments to existing RPC calls now). The benefit of
         allowing for multiple plugin types is that we don't have to standardize this
         layer. But as we've seen from experience it's way easier to implement plugins
         if you can reuse something like that framework that does 80% of the work for

    When you set up an IToT node, it doesn't matter which ledger you connect
    to first. Just like it doesn't matter whether you connect to the internet
    via WiFi or Ethernet or 3G. The easiest way to set up an IToT node, so far,
    is using a NodeJS script running on your laptop, in combination with an XRP
    testnet account. First, we need an Interledger payment script. Interledger
    payments are quite simple in fact, you just need to send the generate a random
    string called the fulfillment, and then send the SHA256 hash of that fulfillment
    along with your ledger-specific transfer. If you pay to yourself then you can
    easily reply to the incoming payment from the same script, using the fulfillment
    of the SHA256 condition. ...

Mid-request payments

  - To increase speed http response with a 402 status is dropped in the shop server (avoid client's disconnection)
   , return 200 status, flush the headers, and stall the delivery of the body. The body will consist of the letters 
   the client buys, and will keep streaming them indefinitely, until the client interrupts the connection
   , or the server process is terminated:

   res.writeHead(200, {
     'Pay': [ 1, plugin.getAccount() + '.' + user, base64(secret) ].join(' ')
   })
   // Flush the headers in a first TCP packet:
   res.socket.write(res._header)
   res._headerSent = true

   In the client:
   - res.body.pipe(process.stdout)

  __ Initial setup __
  shop devel -> shop: Add a ledger to the shop app. (private ledger / "trust-line")
  client     -> shop: open account 
  __ (stream) payment __
  client     -> shop: pay letters to client's account at shop.ledger
                      (much faster than XRP)
 
    - The shop's ledger will expose version 1.0 of the Bilateral Transfer Protocol (BTP),
     optimization of the Ledger Plugin Interface (LPI), transported over a WebSocket.
     These BTP packets are similar to the objects passed to plugin.sendTransfer 
     or plugin.fulfillCondition, although they are a bit more concise, and before they
     go onto the WebSocket, they are serialized into OER buffers.

  <a href="https://github.com/interledger/rfcs/pull/384"> PR: Remove chunked payments from PSKv2</a>
  <p>
  Draft 1 attempted to have PSKv2 handle one-off payments, streaming payments, 
  and chunked payments. However, <a href="https://github.com/sharafian" class="user-mention">@sharafian</a> 
  made good points (summarized <a href="https://gist.github.com/emschwartz/235ac5bdfcd0a6b07315a248c0cd84ee">here</a>) 
  that some of the features in the protocol and implementation of PSKv2 were only useful for
  chunked payments and not for streaming. When streaming payments, it makes more sense to have
  a completely stateless receiver that has a single callback to handle all incoming chunks,
  and applications will want more direct control over how they determine whether to
  accept or reject individual packets. Also, we wanted to
  <a href="https://github.com/interledgerjs/ilp-protocol-psk2/issues/5">support application data</a> 
  but PSKv2 did not go all the way to implementing segmentation and reassembly like TCP.
  (<a href="https://github.com/sentientwaffle" class="user-mention">@sentientwaffle</a> 
  also asked the first time he read the spec why we didn't separate the chunked 
  payments part from the rest of PSKv2)
  </p>
  <p>This change simplifies the protocol and includes only the features necessary for:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Generating the conditions and fulfillments from a shared secret</li>
    <li>Encrypting and authenticating request and response data</li>
    <li>Providing the sender a way to indicate to the receiver the minimum
        amount they should get to accept a given packet.</li>

dora-gt Is there any material to refer about amount control, like... 
- if I want to send $10 by XRP, how to control destination amount?
- if I want the receiver to receive just $10. How to make it accurate in the higher layer without using ILQP.

Evan Schwartz @emschwartz Feb 04 19:22 @dora-gt great question. 
That type of functionality is now in the transport layer, rather than the Interledger layer:
- If you want to specify a minimum that the receiver should accept for a certain packet, 
  that can be included in the ILP Prepare data as is done in PSK2
  (https://github.com/interledger/rfcs/pull/384/files#diff-d46f90d06e8466d8aba6f793b0f26a25R167 )
- If you want to determine the path exchange rate you can send an unfulfillable test payment and 
   ask the receiver how much arrived, also done in PSK2 
  (https://github.com/interledger/rfcs/pull/384/files#diff-d46f90d06e8466d8aba6f793b0f26a25R203 ).

- The two major changes with ILPv4:
  - some of the fields moved from  Ledger Layer's transfer object UP to the ILP packet (Interledger layer)

  - some of the functionality that was in the Interledger layer was moved into the transport layer.

  We realized that you could get the same benefits from ILQP and having the fixed destination amount
  in the ILP packet without needing all of the connectors and the core of the network
  to have special functionality for that

The changes I do think affect functionality when seen from the outside, are: 

Payment Changes for ILPv4:
 +-------------------------+--------------+---------------------+
 |Dropped                  | Replaced by  | Advantage           |
 +-------------------------+--------------+---------------------+
 |fixed-destination-amount | best-effort  | no more need for    |
 |                         |              | price-based routing |
 +-------------------------+--------------+---------------------+
 | multi-dollar            | sub-dollar   | no more need for    |
 |                         |              | on-ledger escrow    |
 +-------------------------+--------------+---------------------+

"""A node that wants to allow anonymous senders to send payments through it can simply require them to prefund the payments. An implementation of this is available using XRP Payment Channels"""

Evan Schwartz @ Gitter: """Chunked payments are not atomic so it is theoretically possible that a payment could complete 80% and then you'd need to get the receiver to send the money back. However, I think that case might be more analogous to having all the internet cables between here and Japan cut suddenly. It's theoretically possible, and it would definitely impact our experience of communicating, but in practice it's not something we worry about on a day to day basis. If a payment completes only 80% and there's absolutely no liquidity to finish it, there's a decent chance that we have bigger problems to worry about."""

Evan Schwartz @ Gitter: """Connectors have a risk that their peers will not settle with them for the full value of payments they've sent through. The mitigations for that are to limit your exposure to whatever level you're comfortable with. If your settlement mechanism is free, like payment channel updates, you could keep the amount you need to trust your peers for very low."""

Payment-pointer tutorial:
https://github.com/interledger/tutorials/blob/53b6930b158d5921add604346cc319d97dc1bf02/payment-pointer/index.md

 1 Create your payment pointer

   npm install -g ilp-spsp-server
   DEBUG=* ilp-spsp-server --subdomain michielbdejong

 2 Pay yourself

   npm install -g ilp-spsp
   DEBUG=* ilp-spsp send --receiver '$michielbdejong.localtunnel.me' --amount 100

You should see something like:

   paying 100 to "$michielbdejong.localtunnel.me"...
   sent!
