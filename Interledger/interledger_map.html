    <ul>
      <li>
         open protocol suite for sending payments across different ledgers.
         The open architecture and minimal protocol enable interoperability for any value transfer system.
         Interledger is not tied to any one company, blockchain, or currency.<br/>
         Note: In ILP ledgers do still keep in charge of double-entry bookkeeping. 
         Interledger is used to synchronize transfers (sets of debits and credits) 
         across multiple ledgers
      </li>
      <li>
          <a href="https://github.com/interledger/rfcs/pull/266">ILP as Settlement vs Clearing System</a> and design implications
          """3 very different views of ILP according to what we build:
          <ul>
            <li>Interledger as a SETTLEMENT System (ORIGINAL VIEW) <br/>
               The abstraction for the ledger layer would do everything expected: conditional transfers, messages.. 
               ("Ledger Plugin Interface", "Common Ledger Protocol"...), and why we think of trustlines as an unusual type of ledger.
            </li>
            <li>Interledger as a CLEARING System (CURRENT VIEW September 2017) <br/>
              connectors as central actors acting as "clearing houses".<br/>
              NORMAL CASE: connectors have some credit/trustlines relationship with each other. ILP payments go through them<br/>
              UNUSUAL CASE:  You send every transfer through some ledger<br/>
              It makes sense to standardize the clearing protocol:<br/>
              entitities needed by connectors to clear payments: [transfers, fulfillments, rejections, quotes, route broadcasts]<br/>
              """settle is completely divorced from clearing payments""". 
              In this case, when dealing with a ledger treat it as if there were an imaginary connector in the middle
              that you're talking to and you'd hack the functions it doesn't provide natively on top
              (credit to @michielbdejong for this way of looking at it).
            </li>
            <li>The Internet *WITH* VALUE (FUTURISTIC VIEW) <br/> 
              STACK BOTTOM LAYER: ability to send free requests, paid requests, and conditionally paid requests between connectors.<br/>
              ON TOP: ILP Address namespace used to forward packets from multiple different protocols to the destination.<br/>
              ILP payments are just one application built on top of conditionally paid requests. You could also add the ability to relay messages.<br/>
              """... having DNS records resolve to both an IP and ILP address and let browser choose based on normal Internet /paid Internet.<br/> 
              """...An argument here is that the reason IPv6 didn't really take off was because it offered relatively minor improvements over IPv4.
                 In contrast, ILP introduces the ability to send value as well as information and the ILP Addresses are much more flexible even 
                 than IPv6 addresses."""

          Since there is no central authority goberning ILP address asignation collision between ILP addresses is
          possible but that collision will be detected soon since payments are also protected by sha256 hashes.

     <p cite>....we haven't abandoned the ideal insofar ...
         we still want any many payments as possible to be atomic ...
         we cannot assume that atomic mode will always be available.<br/>
         ... all participants along the payment chain have to have full
         unconditional trust in the notary ... in order to be able to use
         atomic mode all of the time, there must be at least one notary that 
         is trusted by all people in the world. Otherwise, we may
         run into situations where a liquidity path is available, but no valid
         notary can be selected.<br/>
         
         It is possible to use multiple notaries in a payment, but that actually
         doesn't make the trust problem easier and arguably makes it harder... 
         then we now need all participants to trust notaries such that none 
         of the notaries they trust would ever collude with any other notary they trust.
         <br/>
         ...
         <b>It is possible to use atomic mode in the context of a universal mode
         payment. Any number of participants can decide to make the transfer between
         them subsidiary to some notary. If all the participants do that,
         congratulations, the payment is fully atomic.<br/>
         
         SO THE IDEA IS TO DEFAULT TO UNIVERSAL MODE AND USE ATOMIC WHERE POSSIBLE
         </b>
         
         Ripple is currently building a proprietary network for banks that uses
         atomic mode internally and universal mode externally.<br/>
         
         ...XRP Atomic Mode Autodetection (XAMA). The idea is to allow participants in 
         a payment to detect that XRP is used as one of the hops and then defer to
         the outcome of the XRP transaction instead of using their own timeouts, 
         effectively making the XRP Ledger a de-facto notary.
          This can be generalized as a defer-right and defer-left behavior.
          Any neighboring pair of participants (:= sender|receiver|connector) can
         - by mutual agreement - decide to defer the outcome of their
         transfer to whatever the outcome on the ledger right of them or the ledger
         left of them.<br/>

In my experience to date, it's most often people familiar with existing
payment systems that want atomic mode. I think that in time <b>we'll find that
complete end to end atomicity comes at a cost that is not justified for a
lot of payments.</b><br/>

<b>... There are operational costs that must be covered but ... the cost to 
move the bytes from A to B to make a payment is certainly nowhere
near the 1% and up that most payments cost to send.</b><br/>

<b>In a world where ILP is a foundational layer ...  it's still possible
 for someone to send a payment at almost zero cost if they accept the 
 associated risks.</b>

<div xxsmall>
<p> Ledger layer components don't have to understand ILP unless they choose to
re-use the condition for their own local transfer. Ledgers themselves
*never* have to understand ILP.</p>

<p>Remember a ledger layer protocol could use a completely different
conditional payments scheme, like atomic mode ILP, where it takes the
end-to-end condition and creates a new compound condition that depends on
the fulfillment and some notary signature.</p>

          <li>**BTP Connection**: websocket connection over which BTP packets are
            sent. Websockets (as opposed to raw TLS sockets) are used because they provide
            message framing and can be used from the browser.
          </li>
          <li>**BTP Packets**: protocol data units formally defined in ASN.1</li>
          <li>**Peers** are the parties on a BTP connection. Your peer is the party on the
              other side of the BTP connection.</li>
          <li>**Bilateral Ledger**: (not to be confused with the **Underlying (settlement) Ledger**)
              ledger which the peers on a BTP connection are keeping track of.
              When a peer keeping Authoritative State receives a BTP
              packet, they process it and adjust their copy of the bilateral ledger.
          </li>
          <li>**Authoritative State**: authoritative view of the Bilateral Ledger's
          state, maintained by one (one peer must the other ) or both of the peers
          (they can get into dispute due to timeouts+race-conditions)</li>
          <li>**request is In-Flight**: if the request has been sent out, but no response has been sent yet</li>
          <li>**transfer is In-Flight**: if it has been prepared but not yet fulfilled nor rejected</li>
          <li>**Underlying Ledger**: moves value between the two peers when they settle their balance</li>
        </ul>

client -> local connector: sendData(payment-data)
...
client &lt;- local connector: fulfillment (payment receipt) OR ILP error
</pre>
      </li>
       <li>SPSP may be used by end-user applications, such as a digital wallet with a user interface

       <li>SPSP is NOT enforced and other protocols and/or procedures can be used</li>

    ILP virtual ledger plugin for directly transacting connectors, 
    including a framework for attaching on-ledger settlement mechanisms.
    <p>
      """Any ledger protocol author can definitely fork CLP, or 
         design something completely different from scratch.<br/>
         However, as we've found writing ledger plugins, it's much easier to
         use something like the payment channel framework than implement everything
         yourself. That framework will be changed to use the CLP as the base protocol
         and allow individual plugins to add custom messages (in the same way you can
         add custom RPC methods now) and custom data to existing messages (in the same
         way you can add custom arguments to existing RPC calls now). The benefit of
         allowing for multiple plugin types is that we don't have to standardize this
         layer. But as we've seen from experience it's way easier to implement plugins
         if you can reuse something like that framework that does 80% of the work for
         you (and avoids common gotchas)"""

    Ripple Network is a real-time international gross settlement system 
    (<a href='http://treasurytoday.com/2004/12/gross-and-net-settlement-systems'>gross vs net settlement system compared</a>),
    used for currency exchange and money transfer network. <br/>
    Ripple is based on the idea "secure, instant and nearly free global financial transactions of any size with no chargebacks." 
    The Ripple protocol enables the instant and direct transfer of money between two parties. As such the protocol can
    circumnavigate the fees and wait times of the traditional correspondent banking system.
    </p>
    <p>
    Ripple relies on a common shared ledger that has its contents decided on by consensus, and which is a distributed
    database storing information about all Ripple accounts.

Pay-Token and Pay-Balance headers:
 - what if you could pay more than the invoice amount, to obtain a prepaid balance at the shop?
 - If the ledger(s) over which your payment travels are slow or expensive to use, 
   and you know you will probably need to buy more letters in the future,
   it could make sense to pay extra, and obtain a balance at the shop, represented by a token.

 - STEP 1: decouple retrieval of the letter from fulfillment of the payment:
   instead of sending the fulfillment as proof of payment, the client will 
   send its shared secret to prove that they are the client that has a certain
   prepaid balance at the shop.

   client -> shop  : HTTP Request  Header 'Pay-Token'
   shop   -> client: HTTP Response Header 'Pay-Balance'  (current balance of client)

Customer-generated shared secret:
 - final optimization: allow client to pick its own shared secret, useful when
   a user has two devices (one for paying, one for consuming), and these devices are
   not connected to each other, but they do have a shared secret between them
   (for instance, the same ssh key is installed on both devices). The user can then
   use one device to put prepaid credit *on* that shared secret at the shop,
   and use the other devices to consume the letter.

   client -> shop  : HTTP Request 'Pay-Token' header (first request) like
                     const sharedSecret = crypto.randomBytes(32)
                     
                     plugin.connect().then(function () {
                       return fetch('http://localhost:8000/', {
                         headers: {
                           'Pay-Token': base64url(sharedSecret)
                         }
                       })
                     })
   shop  -> shop: use sharedSecret from client like
                  const sharedSecret = crypto.randomBytes(32)

                  // Use client-generated shared secret, if presented:
                  if (req.headers['Pay-Token']) {
                    sharedSecret = Buffer.from(req.headers['Pay-Token'], 'base64')
                    console.log('Accepted shared secret from client', req.headers['Pay-Token'])
                  }

                  // Store the shared secret to use when we get paid

ILP Curl:

  - two final changes are needed in order to become compatible with beta http-ilp:
    In the shop HTTP server:
      1.- (shop to client response) Pay header: remove 'interledger-psk '
      2.- use a different string to identify the XRP testnet ledger

  - Test it like: 
    $ npm install -g ilp-curl
    $ ilp-curl -X GET localhost:8000
    Your letter: A

  - Behind the scenes, ilp-curl does the following:

    - get an account on the XRP testnet and save the credentials in your ~/.ilprc.json if you don't have that file yet
    - read your plugin credentials from your ~/.ilprc.json file (this file replaces ./plugins.js)
    - generate a shared secret for http://localhost:8000
    - make an OPTIONS request to http://localhost:8000 to send the shared secret to the shop and learn the price of one letter
    - use an Interledger payment to deposit money into the prepaid account at the shop
    - retrieve one letter
    - print the result

Koa-ILP module:

    - allows to rewrite the Letter Shop server so that instead of the built-in http library,
      it will use the more powerful koa, which is a webserver middleware framework which is
      very popular among frontend developers like (shop-koa.js):

      |const plugin = require('./plugins.js').xrp.Shop()
      |const Koa = require('koa')
      |const app = new Koa()
      |const router = require('koa-router')()
      |
      |// work around https://github.com/interledgerjs/ilp-plugin/pull/1
      |plugin._prefix = 'g.crypto.ripple.escrow.'
      |
      |// We use the plugin to create a new koa middleware.  This allows us to add a
      |// function to any endpoint that we want to ILP enable.
      |const KoaIlp = require('koa-ilp')
      |const ilp = new KoaIlp({ plugin })
      |
      |// On the server's root endpoint, we add this ilp.paid() function, which
      |// requires payment of 1000 XRP drops (0.001 XRP) in order to run the main
      |// function code
      |router.get('/', ilp.paid({ price: 1000 }), async ctx => {
      |  const letter = ('ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ').split('')[(Math.floor(Math.random() * 26))]
      |  console.log('Sending letter:', letter)
      |  ctx.body = 'Your letter: ' + letter
      |})
      |
      |// Add the route we defined to the application and then listen on port 8000.
      |app
      |  .use(router.routes())
      |  .use(router.allowedMethods())
      |  .listen(8000)

admin -> admin: start new server like 
                $ DEBUG=* node shop-koa.js

$ curl -X GET localhost:8000/ -H Pay-Token:BPtQLNWS7owdlvFlNkMKbVjpBlmvuh1A-V47XdYmeW8

    When you set up an IToT node, it doesn't matter which ledger you connect
    to first. Just like it doesn't matter whether you connect to the internet
    via WiFi or Ethernet or 3G. The easiest way to set up an IToT node, so far,
    is using a NodeJS script running on your laptop, in combination with an XRP
    testnet account. First, we need an Interledger payment script. Interledger
    payments are quite simple in fact, you just need to send the generate a random
    string called the fulfillment, and then send the SHA256 hash of that fulfillment
    along with your ledger-specific transfer. If you pay to yourself then you can
    easily reply to the incoming payment from the same script, using the fulfillment
    of the SHA256 condition. ...

    JS FROG: BTP Toolbox
    
    BTP "TO" FROG "TO" Existing ledgers
    
    FROG wraps an existing connector plugin (for example five-bells-plugin) into a BTP connection. 

    New implementations are encouraged to natively support BTP and can run alongside a ledger adaptor 
    such as Frog in the BTP Toolbox which can load ledger plugins as required and wrap
    these in a BTP interface.
___________________________

   Q: can we ask you what "repudiable" mean? 
   A: "Repudiable" in ILP means that someone can neglect having made 
      a payment or received the payment and nobody else can probe he 
      is lying (or confirm he is telling the true).  So there is a
      dispute between sender and receiver (or connector in the payment path). 
      non-repudiable by contrast mean that the people involved have a
      (cryptographic) probe that anyone else has executed or rejected the payment .
   
   Q: so in ilp when we use sps -> repudiable and when we use ipr -> non-repudiable? 
   A: yes.  The spsp is ussually "good enough" because the payment sender can present the
      fulfillment to connectors to probe that the payment was recieved by the recipient even 
      if it wasn't ... but he will not win much with that. He will just loose his money  
   
       The receiver can not probe the opposite but he just received money for free.
   
      IPR is just needed in some "corner" scenarios when the receiver could be fined 
      because un-intentionally he received the money and he was obligated
      to declare the error to some authority. 
      IPR is "slightly" safer, 100% non-repudiable, but takes more message rounds 
      between sender and receiver and so it less suitable for small payments.

""" justmoon commented on Nov 23, 2017

2016 me would respond: What if g.one.two.three. is a subledger? Users are supposed to be able to subdivide their accounts if they like.

2017 me thinks: Post-enlightenment I think we should get rid of the concept of a ledger prefix entirely. Connectors should just forward based on the longest matching prefix in their routing table. They should not make a futile attempt to guess whether they are the last ones to forward the payment or not. They should not assume anything about the structure of the ILP address.

I think that my distinction between forward and deliver was a big mistake. Without it, connectors are simpler (no more isLocal) and user accounts are more powerful (anyone can easily create subledgers in any currency.)"""

_______________________________
https://github.com/interledger/rfcs/pull/341#issuecomment-352186733
 In some cases, you may have a ledger that is fast enough to do ILP transactions, but does not have an ILP connector built-in, e.g. something like five-bells-ledger. In that case, you can simulate a connector in the plugin. If the ILP destination address starts with a ledger prefix that the plugin is configured with, it takes the first segment after the plugin and forwards the payment to that account. Otherwise, it forwards the payment to the default connector on that ledger. (getInfo().connectors[0])

ILPv4 BTP notes:
    REF: //github.com/interledgerjs/ilp-plugin-btp/
  Q  earizon
     Looking at the JS activity (https://github.com/interledgerjs/ilp-plugin-btp), I think the idea to implement rfc issue 359 is to use a base parent BTP plugin that can be adapted to any type of trust-line/payment-channel by child class. Is that correct?
    The BTP acronym confuses me because I thought that "ILPv4" supersedes "BTP", but it still makes sense to me to implement using this way, or maybe I'm lost.
    
    From a practical point of view, my doubt is whether to implement a BTP-packet in quilt. (I think that's the case, but not 100% sure after all the ILP-enlightment changes)
    Otherwise said, using a developper friendly language:

    We can choose!  BTP is just a wrapper around ILP packets that makes it easier to send them over WebSockets. So our first choice is, do we want Quilt to use WebSockets or HTTP for its API? I would vote for HTTP. @earizon @adrianhopebailie @sappenin @nathanaw what would be your preference?
    I guess advantage of HTTP is that it's easier. Advantage of WebSockets is that it allows a client (so a computer that's not publicly addressable, e.g. a laptop or phone) to be a receiver, and that some JavaScript-based connectors may only support WebSockets (but if a JavaScript-based connector wants to peer with a Java-based one, it would be easy to add ilp-plugin-http)

    To answer your question about ilp-plugin-btp, it's indeed confusing that we still call it BTP without differentiating; I think maybe we should call it BTP/2.0, see https://github.com/interledgerjs/ilp-plugin-btp/issues/2 
    https://github.com/interledgerjs/ilp-plugin-btp/issues/2



Also, we need to explicitly document (since it's so confusing) that the new Transfer/Response/Error sequence decreases (settles) the sender's unsecuredAmount. This is the opposite of how in BTP/1.0 the Prepare/Fulfill/Reject sequence used to increase (cause) the sender's unsecuredAmount,
see interledger/rfcs#360 (comment). It would be easy to oversee this difference, and think that Transfer/Response/Error is just the unconditional version of Prepare/Fulfill/Reject. Or maybe we should just say "forget everything you think you know about BTP". :)

ILP Streaming Tutorial https://interledger.org/tutorials/streaming-payments/ {

  Just use an increasing paymentId++ (And do NOT disconnect in the outgoing_fulfill handler)

Mid-request payments

  - To increase speed http response with a 402 status is dropped in the shop server (avoid client's disconnection)
   , return 200 status, flush the headers, and stall the delivery of the body. The body will consist of the letters 
   the client buys, and will keep streaming them indefinitely, until the client interrupts the connection
   , or the server process is terminated:

   res.writeHead(200, {
     'Pay': [ 1, plugin.getAccount() + '.' + user, base64(secret) ].join(' ')
   })
   // Flush the headers in a first TCP packet:
   res.socket.write(res._header)
   res._headerSent = true

   In the client:
   - res.body.pipe(process.stdout)
}

  -  how to use a hosted ledger to speed things up
    Bilateral Transfer Protocol (BTP) and its relation to ILP

  __ Initial setup __
  shop devel -> shop: Add a ledger to the shop app. (private ledger / "trust-line")
  client     -> shop: open account 
  __ (stream) payment __
  client     -> shop: pay letters to client's account at shop.ledger
                      (much faster than XRP)
 
  trustline types: symmetrical/asymmetrical
    - An asymmetrical trustline is a ledger with two account holders,
      and one of them is also the ledger administrator.
    - A   symmetrical trustline is a ledger with two account holders,
      who collaborate on an equal basis to administer the 
      ledger between them.

    - The shop's ledger will expose version 1.0 of the Bilateral Transfer Protocol (BTP),
     optimization of the Ledger Plugin Interface (LPI), transported over a WebSocket.
     These BTP packets are similar to the objects passed to plugin.sendTransfer 
     or plugin.fulfillCondition, although they are a bit more concise, and before they
     go onto the WebSocket, they are serialized into OER buffers.

"Proxying" Ledgers
C&P: Michiel de Jong
"""So far we mainly considered subscription-based ledgers, where the recipient
   of a transfer needs to be connected to the ledger 24 hours a day, for
   instance by keeping a websocket open. I think this is a big burden on both
   the user and the ledger, and would like to propose an alternative: get rid
   of subscriptions, and use a "proxying ledger" instead."""
