     CUADERNOS PRÁCTICOS DE GESTIÓN EMPRESARIAL 50 CONCEPTOS BÁSICOS DE TESORERÍA
    6.1 GESTIÓN DE LOS DERECHOS DE COBRO Y DE LAS OBLIGACIONES DE PAGO
    DERECHOS DE COBRO

    La empresa puede conceder un crédito comercial a sus clientes o deudores en lugar de cobrarles al contado.


    Eso  no  tiene  porque  significar  una  renuncia  a  la  disponibilidad  de  ese  dinero.  Existen  instrumentos  
    financieros para transformar estos derechos de cobro en efectos de giro, como las letras de cambio, el 
    factoring o el confirming. 


    En el caso de girar una letra de cambio se pueden producir distintas posibilidades:
    - No hacer nada, esperar a vencimiento de las letras y presentarlas él mismo al cobro.
    - Encomendar la gestión de cobro a una entidad financiera. En este caso, el autónomo envía 
    el  documento  representativo  de  la  letra  de  cambio  a  una  entidad  financiera  para  que  se  
    ocupe de gestionar su cobro a cambio de una comisión y una serie de costes asociados. No 
    se va adelantar el cobro.
    - Descontarlas en una entidad financiera. En este caso sí se estaría adelantando el cobro de la 
    deuda. Se envía el documento a una entidad financiera, quien además de gestionar su cobro
    también anticipará el importe líquido de las letras, una vez deducidos del valor nominal, 
    réditos, comisión y otros costes asociados.
    - Endosarlas. Se cedería el derecho de cobro a un tercero como medio de pago de una deu-
    da contraída con él mismo.


    CONFIRMING
    Instrumento financiero por el que un empresario cede el pago de sus facturas a un gestor que, a cambio
    de un precio y una posible financiación del pago, se compromete bien a pagar a sus acreedores, 
    bien a anticiparles el pago.


    FACTORING
    Instrumento financiero por el que un empresario obtiene el pago anticipado de sus facturas cediendo 
    el cobro de estas a cambio de una comisión y/o unos costes financieros. Consiste en el anticipo de las 
    facturas emitidas a los clientes por parte de la entidad bancaria; podemos transmitir o no el derecho 
    de cobrode un precio y una posible financiación del pago, se compromete bien a pagar a sus acreedores, 
    bien a anticiparles el pago.


    OBLIGACIONES DE PAGO
    Los empresarios deben de hacer frente a una serie de obligaciones de pago derivadas de las deudas 
    contraídas en el desarrollo de su actividad económica. 
    Esas deudas serán fundamentalmente con:

    PROVEEDORES O SUMINISTRADORES DE MERCANCÍAS
    Suministradores de otros bienes o servicios diferentes (acreedores)
    
    ADMINISTRACIONES  PÚBLICAS
    En la mayoría de los casos, tienen un vencimiento a corto plazo, a 30, 60 o 90 días. La función como 
    gestor de la tesorería es intentar conseguir las condiciones más favorables posibles con sus acreedores, 
    para poder alargar todo lo que pueda el plazo del pago

TRUSTLINES NETWORK
  | http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/introducing-trustlines-original-ripple-idea-ethereum-1607226
  | 
  | 
  | The Trustlines Network brings "people powered money" to users as public, permissionless payments without the need of a credit card, government ID or a bank account. It is a decentralised platform for customizable, interoperable complementary currencies which comes as a mobile payment app.
  | 
  | The network is the brainchild of Ethereum developer Heiko Hees and the team behind Raiden, which is bringing state channel functionality to Ethereum. Speaking at Edcon in Paris, Heiko said that the Trustlines network is based on the original ripple pay idea in which payments can be facilitated through a chain of 'friends of friends'.
  | 
  | "Lending money between trusted friends is no problem, but what about strangers?" he said. "Based on this foundation of technology you can have a chain or path of trust relationships and chain them together in such a way to have payments between participants on the network that don't know each other."
  | 
  | 
  | Once credit lines have been established it creates what in the real world would be called IOUs. Looking at the network of trust lines, these can be used to find pathways to make payments between people who are part of trust lines but do not have trust lines between them.
  | 
  | Payment channels are already being built on Ethereum with contracts on the blockchain which know who the senders and receivers are, where tokens can be held in escrow. In the case of state channels, an off-chain tally of transactions is signed with digital signatures and when those signatures are accepted some goods, for instance, can be exchanged up to the value on deposit or in escrow in the smart contract.
  | 
  | Heiko pointed out that building a payment channel system around credit lines between peers is not a new idea: the accepted fractional reserve banking model where you deposit money to a bank means you are creating a credit line to the bank.
  | 
  | "This sort of system is thousands of years old so it's a powerful idea. We see it with hawala systems [a trust-based transaction system]. Of course, a blockchain is better because you get a notary.
  | "Think about all the unbanked people of the world who have smartphones. It make sense to implement on Ethereum, which is a payments network, and scaling it with the Raiden network and sharding. We are doing this anyway."

Hedging contract:

  | 1. Wait for party A to input 1000 ether
  | 2. Wait for party B to input 1000 ether
  | 3. Record the USD value of 1000 ether, calculated by querying the data feed contract,
  |    in storage, say this is $x.
  | 4. After 30 days, allow A or B to "ping" the contract in order to send $x worth of ether 
  |    (calculated by querying the data feed contract again to get the new price) to A and the
  |    rest to B.


Hedging contract use-case
  | Up until now, the most commonly proposed solution has been issuer-backed assets; the idea is that an issuer creates a sub-currency in which they have the right to issue and revoke units, and provide one unit of the currency to anyone who provides them (offline) with one unit of a specified underlying asset (eg gold, USD). The issuer then promises to provide one unit of the underlying asset to anyone who sends back one unit of the crypto-asset. 
  | 
  |  In practice, however, issuers are not always trustworthy, or the network infrastructure is too weak/hostile. Financial derivatives provide an alternative. Here, instead of a single issuer providing the funds to back up an asset, a decentralized market of speculators, betting that the price of a cryptographic reference asset will go up, plays that role. Unlike issuers,  speculators have no options to default on their side of the bargain because the hedging contract holds their funds in escrow. Note that this approach is not fully decentralized, because a  trusted source is still needed to provide the price ticker, although arguably even still this is a massive improvement in terms of reducing infrastructure requirements (unlike being an issuer, issuing a price feed requires no licences and can likely be categorized as free speech) and reducing the potential for fraud.
  | 


Namecoin (like) name registration system:

  |   if !contract.storage[tx.data[0]]:
  |       contract.storage[tx.data[0]] = tx.data[1]
  | 
  | All it is is a database inside the Ethereum network that can be added to, but not modified or removed from. Anyone can register a name with some value, and that registration then sticks forever. A more sophisticated name registration contract will also have a "funcion clause"  allowing other contracts to query it, as well as a mechanism for the "owner" (ie, the first registerer) of a name to change the data or transfer ownership. One can even add reputation and web-of-trust functionality on top.

https://bluehorizon.network/documentation/introduction

   Horizon is designed to encourage cross-vendor collaboration in an open, decentralized ecosystem.  Horizon facilitates automated, vendor independent
   machine-machine decision-making and cooperation. Horizon welcomes new devices, provides introductions to other devices, and when desired it 
   can help both parties to leverage the mutual trust of a third party to safely connect and cooperate.
   
   Horizon creates a decentralized fabric that enables any Edge (connected device) to directly connect to any other Edge to facilitate the processing
    (filtering, analytics, etc…) of streaming data -- beginning right at the source.  Processing the data at its source creates higher value data streams.
    That higher value data can then be used locally for immediate and autonomous actions with sub-millisecond response times (hundreds or thousands of
    times faster than cloud-based solutions).
   
   Horizon can enhance traditional cloud applications where remote devices centrally aggregate and analyze Edge data or remotely initiate Edge actions.  
   By migrating these solutions to Horizon, vendors can gain access to an open ecosystem, and can add features to cooperate with devices from other
    vendors.  By moving to Horizon, vendors can also automate their firmware upgrade procedures, and make their devices more responsive in the field.

Bailment describes a legal relationship in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_law" >common law</a> where physical possession of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_property"  >personal property</a>, or a chattel, is transferred from one person (the "bailor")
 to another person (the "bailee") who subsequently has
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Possession_(law)"  >possession</a>
of the property. It arises when a person gives property to someone else for safekeeping, and is a cause of action independent of

 The term is also used to denote the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property" >property</a> which constitutes the security. A pledge is type of

<p>Pledge is the <i>pignus</i> of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_law" >Roman law</a>, from which most of the modern European-based
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law" >law</a> on the subject is derived, but is generally a feature of even the most basic legal systems. It differs from
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothecation" >hypothecation</a> and from the more usual
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_law" >mortgage</a> in that the pledge is in the possession of the pledgee. It is similar, however, in that all three can
 apply to personal and real property. A pledge of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_property" >personal property</a> is known as a
