  Introduction
<pre xxxsmall zoom>
<b>Blockchain is an specialized database whose main purpose is to
track the "rights" and "obligations" of its participants.</b>
 
The first blokchain put into production, the Bitcoin Network, as 
well as many other public blockchain are specialized databases 
to track the crypto-currency owned by all and anyone of its
participants. Notice that money is just a "right" (from the owner's
point of view) or an "obligation" (from the bank emissor's point of view)

More feature-rich blockchains will provide with programable logic
(smart-contracts) to describe advanced forms of "rights" and "obligations",
that describe common contracts used by financial entities or industry.

This specialization arise from the following <b>three distintive characteristics</b>:

 1) All "inputs" modifying the state are cryptographically signed.

 2) All "inputs" must have being previously acepted by a network-consensus
    before being accepted by the blockchain.

 3) The log of accepted inputs (accepted signed transactions) is
    inmutable. 

1) By forcing all inputs (transactions modifying the state) to be signed 
   the blockchain guaranties that:

  - Transactions can not be tampered by anyone by the owner of 
    the private key.

  - The transaction is non-repudiable: The signer can not neglect
    having signed it.

2) By forcing all inputs to be accepted by the network consensus the blockchain
   guaranties that different participants see the same transactions in the
   same other (See CAP problem later on)

3) By forcing the inmutability of the log the blockchain guaranties
   that accepted transactions can not be removed or modified later in time.

Depending on the consensus applied and the previous agreements by the
blockchain network  participants, <b>the cited characteristics provides a 
legal value to the network.</b>

 In practice when a user signs a transaction, this transaction will always
represent a decrease of its "rights" or an increase of its "obligations".

 To increase a user's "rights" or decrease the user's "obligations" the
possibilities are:

 - Another user will sign a new transaction transfering rights to the
   user or decresing its contracted obligations.

 - In public networks the "mining" proceduce will increase the 
   crypto-currency (rights) to succesful miners.

 - In private networks a previous established agreement between 
   participants will provide a procedure to establish new rights to
   users. (crypto-currency, assets, tokens, ...).

  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem" xbig>CAP-Theorem</a>
<pre xxxsmall zoom>
 In theoretical computer science, the CAP theorem, also named Brewer's theorem
after computer scientist Eric Brewer, states that it is impossible for a 
distributed (distributed == physically distant) data store to simultaneously
provide more than two out of the following three guarantees:
  +------------------------------------------------------+--------------------
  <b>|Consistency                | Availability             | Partition tolerance</b>
  +------------------------------------------------------+--------------------
  |Every read receives the    | Every request receives   | The system continues to 
  |most recent write or       | a (non-error) response   | operate despite an arbitrary
  |an error.                  | – without guarantee that | number of messages being
  |"One truth of what happent | it contains the most     | dropped (or delayed) by the
  |and in what order"         | recent write             | network between nodes
  +------------------------------------------------------+--------------------

Consensus in public blockchains refers to methods to warrant parititon 
tolerance (global vision of state by all nodes), sacrifying availability 
(transactions are sent for "mining" to the network but there is no warranty
of success (even error) response.
- We speak about "Eventual Consistency", if we consider that the network is 
always running but the unique view (consistency) will take time to "propagate" 
using the consensus algorithm.
</pre>

   FLP impossibility Result
<pre xxxsmall zoom>
from: <li>(C&amp;P from <a href="https://tendermint.com/static/docs/tendermint.pdf">1</a>) Fischer, Lynch, and Patterson shown
in "Impossibility of distributed consensus with one faulty process",
(Journal of the ACM, vol 32, n.2, pp 374-382, 1985) that in 
an asynchronous system (where no assumptions are made about time) of
deterministic processes, no protocol can guarantee consensus even with 
one faulty process (non-termination is always a possibility for a
consensus algorithm). This is called the FLP impossibility result.
Much research has gone into understanding ways to circumvent the 
FLP imposibility result by slightly modifying th problem 
domain, e.g, by sacrificing determinism, adding time, adding
oracles, etc... (Byzantine consensus in asynchronous 
message-passing systems:
International Journal of Critical Computer-Based Systems , 
vol. 2, no. 2, pp. 141–161, 2011).  Bitcoin circumvents the FLP
impossibility result by making some pragmatic assumptions about
the synchrony of the network (i.e., nodes sync up soon with the 
network) and time (i.e, miners dedicate limited time and
resources to the best blockchain).  Basically it introduces the
 necessity for time-based heuristics, to ensure convergence 
(or at least repeated iterations of non-convergence).

  <b>Blockchain Overview</b>
<pre xxxsmall zoom>
  <ul xxxsmall zoom>
The whole point of a blockchain is to establish agreement on a 
canonical ordering of a set of transactions.

Over time, participants in the network sign the history, effectively 
endorsing everything that came before it and adding a new set of 
entries to the history. What this means is that a blockchain itself is 
really a kind of collective signature, whose membership is sampled 
repeatedly from a fluctuating distribution of resources allocated in 
the network, this is the "network" in action, or sometimes called consensus.

Agreement refers to the problem of maintaining a single global
truth in the face of a decentralized accounting system.
While similar to the correctness problem, the difference lies
in the fact that while a malicious user of the network may be
unable to create a fraudulent transaction (defying correctness), 
it may be able to create multiple correct transactions that are
somehow unaware of each other, and thus combine to create a fraudulent act.
For example, a malicious user may make two simultaneous purchases, 
with only enough funds in their account to cover each purchase individually,
but not both together.   Thus each transaction by itself is correct,
but if executed simultaneously in such a way that the distributed network
as a whole is unaware of both, a clear problem arises, commonly referred
to as the “Double-Spend Problem” [1]. Thus the agreement problem can be
summarized as the requirement that only one set of globally recognized
transactions exist in the network

One way to define a blockchain is a distributed database (DB) that solves
the "Strong Byzantine Generals" (SBG) problem[13], the name given to a
combination of the Byzantine Generals Problem and the Sybil Attack Problem.
 In the Byzantine Generals Problem [14], nodes need to agree on some value
for a DB entry, under the constraint that the nodes may fail in arbitrary 
ways (including malicious behavior) unfairly disproportionate influence in 
the process of agreeing on a value for an entry.  It's an \attack of the
clones"|an army of seemingly independent voters actually working together
to game the system.

<b>Digital Signature</b>
    Provides the mechanism for triple entry accountancy (signed receipt).
    The signature <b>reflects the intention of asset-owner to pay/transmit assets</b>.

<b>Distributed Consensus:</b>
    Provides the distributed consensus to globally agree on an given shared state

<b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree">Merkle Tree</a></b>
  - certify that (blocks of) data sent/stored is undamaged and unaltered and
    the <b>log is inmutable</b>
  - Used also in file systems (ZFS, Brtfs, ZFS, ...), SCMS (Git, Mercurial)
    backup systems (Tahoe-LAFS), NoSQL ddbbs (Cassandra, Riak, ...), 
    protocols (Dat, Apache Wave), ... </li>
  - The main difference from a hash list is that <b>one branch of the hash tree
     can be downloaded at a time and the integrity of each branch can be checked
     immediately</b>, even though the whole tree is not available yet.

     --------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Related:<a href="https://www.kdnuggets.com/2016/07/postgres-kafka-bitcoin-common.html">Inmutability in Postgres,Kafka&amp;Bitcoin</a>
      """all three of these technologies have one interesting thing in common: their use of the immutable log
      Postgres uses something called an immutable Write-Ahead log, or WAL.
      Modifications of state are appended to the WAL before any significant updates to permanent storage.
      Followers can then read the log to apply these changes to their own copy to guarantee consistency.
  
      In Kafka, streams of data are divided up into partitions, where each partition is an immutable
      log of ordered messages. Every new message that enters the system is appended to a partition. 
      All consumers of the log keep track of what they've consumed themselves, so in case of an error,
      they can pick up from where they left off. And because the messages are ordered, all consumers 
      get them in the same, intended order! No need to worry about race conditions.</li>

      Bitcoin uses an immutable log in the form of something called a blockchain, for all parties
      to agree on a history of transactions. In a blockchain, transactions are bundled into blocks, 
      and each block has data regarding the previous block's hash, creating a chain of blocks. This 
      makes it really hard for malicious agents to tamper with data records because of encryption. 
      If a transaction of block N is tampered, then block N's hash will change, which means block N+1's
      will be referencing a nonexistent block, breaking the blockchain. Even if a malicious agent 
      successfully tampered and re-mined the whole blockchain (which already takes significant 
      processing power), a simple comparison with a different copy of the blockchain would easily find
      tampering, making it hard for people to hack the system.

      Immutability as a concept seems so intuitive, so why have update-in-place approaches been
      the de-facto way of doing things for so long? A big reason is because storage used to be so expensive.
      But now, with advances with processing power and a significant decrease in the cost of storage,
      the solution of immutable logs is much more economically feasible, which means you'll be seeing more
      and more of it being used in technologies in the future. """

  <b orange>Triple Entry Accountancy</b><a href="http://iang.org/papers/triple_entry.html">REF</a>
  <ul xxxsmall zoom>
    <li>3 local entries for each of 3 roles, the result of which I call triple entry accounting.</li>
    <li>Bullet proof accounting systems for aggressive uses</li>
    <li>lowers costs by delivering reliable and supported accounting, </li>
    <li>it makes much stronger governance possible in a way that positively impacts

    <li>Double Entry: add a clear strategy to identify and remove errors.<br/>
       It has a side effect of clearly firewalling errors as either accident
       or fraud.<br/>
       This property is enabled by means of three features:
       <ul>
         <li>separation of all books into two groups or sides, called assets and liabilities</li>
         <li>redundancy of the duplicative double entries with each entry having a match on the other side</li>
         <li>balance sheet equation (sum of all entries on the asset side must equal the sum of all entries on the liabilities side)</li>
       </ul>
     </li>
     <li>This then leads to an audit strategy:
       <ul>
         <li>First, ensure that all entries are complete, in that they refer to their counterpart.</li>
         <li>Second, ensure that all movements of value make sense. </li>
       </ul>
     </li>
     <li>The digital signature is capable of creating a record with some strong degree of reliabilty, at least in the senses expressed by ACID:
       <ul>
         <li>A digital signature can be relied upon to keep a record safe, as it will fail to verify if
  any details in the record are changed</li>
         <li><b>assuming that the original record was created correctly, then later errors are revealed,
   both of an accidental nature and of fraudulent intent.</b></li>
         <li>digital signature gives us a particular property:
  "at a given point in time, this information was seen and marked by the signing computer.
    providing a new way to create reliable and trustworthy entries "
  (variants with softer and harder claims exits like message digests and public key cryptosystems)</li>
       </ul>
     </li>
     <li><b>Initial Role of a Receipt:</b>
   let's assume a simple three party payment system: Alice, Bob (two users) and Ivan (the Issuer)<br/>
  - each party holds an authorising key which can be used to sign their instructions.<br/>
  - Alice wishes to transfer value to Bob in some unit or contract managed by Ivan:
<pre>
    Alice -> Alice : + signed payment instruction ( similar to a cheque)
    Alice -> Ivan  :   signed payment instruction ( similar to a cheque)
    Alice -> Alice :   Update internal set of books
    Ivan  -> Ivan  : + signed (receipt)
    Ivan  -> Alice :   signed (receipt)
    Ivan  -> Bob   :   signed (receipt)
    Ivan  -> Ivan  :   Update internal set of books

   <b blue>The Receipt is the Transaction!!!</b>
  - The Issuer (Ivan) is the risk source of insider fraud:<br/>
    A single centralised server for issuers of the unit of digital value 
    and any governance partners such as the server operators are powerful candidates 
    for insider fraud.<br/>
  - To address the risk of insider fraud, the written issuer signed receipt was historically introduced 
    as being a primary source of evidence.  To achieve a complete binding, Alice's original authorisation
    is also included within the record.

     <li> <b>Most efficient record keeping strategy:<br/>

        This allows us to state the following principle:
        <b>The User and the Issuer hold the same information.</b>
     </li>
     <li>We bind a signed contract of issuance known as a Ricardian Contract into the receipt:<br/>
       This invention relates a digitally signed document securely to the signed receipt by means of a 
       unique identifier called a message digest, again provided by cryptography.
        It provides strong binding for the unit of account, the nature of the issue, the terms, conditions 
       and promises being made by the Issuer, and of course the identity of the Issuer.

     <li>  <b blue>SIGNED RECEIPT AS A BOOK-KEEPING SYSTEM</b></li>
     <li>Single Entry (Signed receipt) system:<br/>
       To calculate balances a book would be constructed on the fly from the set for signed receipts.
       (using the Signed Receipt as a basis for single entry bookkeeping)
     </li>
     <li>Recovering Double Entry:<br/>
        The Issuer server (Ivan) has to accept each new transaction on
        the basis of the available balance in the effected books; 
        for this reason it needs those books to be available efficiently.<br/>
        Alice and Bob both are granted a book each within the server's architecture.<br/>
        We place those books on the liabilities side of the issuer:<br/>
        - Receipts then can be placed in a separate single book (logically placed on the assets side)<br/>
        - Each TX from Alice to Bob now has a logical contra entry, and is then represented
          in 3 places (<b blue>Triple Entry Accounting!!</b>) within the accounts of the server.
     </li>
     <li><b blue><br/>
       - In practice digital signature reduces the accounting problem to one of
         the receipt's presence <br/>
       - Although digitally signed receipt dominates in information terms, in 
         processing terms it falls short.

     <li><b blue>
       It's Worth stating that the technique of signing receipts works both with private
       key signatures and also with entanglement message digest signatures; whether the security aspects
       of these techniques is adequate to task is dependent on the business environment.

     </li>
     <li>Problems: <br/>
     - loss of receipts<br/>
     - counting of balances by the client side software
     </li>
     <li>
       Patterns of Transactions<br/>
        A particular transaction in business almost never stands alone. They come in patterns.
       For example offers and acceptances form a wider transaction but seldom encapsulate the entire
        fulfillment and payment cycle. 
     </li>
     <li>Conclusion<br/>
       Double Entry bookkeeping provides evidence of intent and origin,
       leading to strategies for dealing with errors of accident and fraud. 
       The financial cryptography invention of the signed receipt provides the same benefits,
       and thus challenges the 800 year reign of double entry. Indeed, in evidentiary terms,
       the signed receipt is more powerful than double entry records due to the
       technical qualities of its signature.

From "Hands-on BC with Hyperledger"
""" William Shakespeare said that the world is a stage on which men and women are the actors. 
    The actions amongst actors can be tought of as as transactions....
    A business network is a collection of participants and assets than 
    undergo a life cycle described by transactions. Events occur when 
    transactions complete."""
There are three types of participants in a business network:

- Individual: A "human" like a teacher, student, bank customer, end-customer/end-consumer ...  
- Organizational participants: The most important actors in a business network, a bank,
              school, insurance company, ... A organization out-spans the life-cycle of
              its individuals. In practice individuals will act on behalf of the organization, 
              and with the authority of that organization.
- System or device participants: represent the technology components. Are sort of special 
    individuals, like the ERP system, the payment engines, reservation systems, ...

All participants have an "agency" attribute (act at will - this translate in having
a private key to sign their transaction intentions) and an identity.

 The fundamental nature of a business network—that it is comprised of participants
involved in the meaningful exchange of assets.
<b>The most important concept in business networks is the exchange.</b>

A blockchain can provide a simpler, more comprehensive, approach to business-
to-business (B2B) information processing across multiple organizations. 
Whereas Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) protocols are only concerned with 
the exchange of information, a blockchain can store data in a ledger, process 
data with smart contracts, and communicate and exchange data via consensus. 
Blockchain provides a holistic approach to multi-party transaction processing
. In a blockchain, all the processing, data, and communications in a business 
network are accessed from one coherent system. That's in contrast to a 
traditional B2B approach where data, processing, and exchange are managed by 
different systems. This separation directly results in significant amounts 
processing to join-up information across these systems, and a lack of overall 
transparency. This process is described as reconciliation—it ensures that 
that there are not significant differences between the information at 
different parts of the business network—it is timely and costly.

We now see the benefits of implementing a business network on a blockchain. 
Rather than a set of different systems that record assets, and different 
programs that operate on them, there is a shared view of the asset and its 
complete transactional life cycle. Blockchain provides an explicit shared 
understanding of the asset and its life cycle, of participants, transactions, 
and events. This shared nature of blockchain provides increased trust through 
increased transparency, and that radically simplifies and accelerates 
processing. For example, organizations don't have to perform periodic 
reconciliation with other counterparts to make sure that their systems tally—
because everything tallies all the time, in a blockchain.

    <li>One factor in evaluating a system's security is its complexity.
    If the design, implementation, or security mechanisms are highly complex, 
    then the likelihood of security vulnerabilities increases. Subtle problems 
    in complex systems may be difficult to find, especially in copious amounts 
    of code. For instance, analyzing the source code that is responsible for the
    normal execution of a functionality can be a difficult task, but checking 
    for alternate behaviors in the remaining code that can achieve the same 
    functionality can be even more difficult. One strategy for simplifying code
    is the use of choke points, where shared functionality reduces the amount 
    of source code required for an operation. Simplifying design or code is not
    always easy, but developers should strive for implementing simpler systems 
    when possible.</li>
    <li>According to Saltzer and Schroeder [Saltzer 75] in "Basic Principles of
      Information Protection" from page 8:<br/>
      Economy of mechanism: Keep the design as simple and small as possible. This 
      well-known principle applies to any aspect of a system, but it deserves 
      emphasis for protection mechanisms for this reason: design and 
      implementation errors that result in unwanted access paths will not be 
      noticed during normal use (since normal use usually does not include 
      attempts to exercise improper access paths). As a result, techniques such 
      as line-by-line inspection of software and physical examination of hardware

  <b>What is a smart contract?</b>
  <ul xxxsmall zoom >
    <li>That depends on the model of computation we are talking about.
      There are two competing computational models used in decentralised
      databases: [ virtual  computer ,  UTXO ]:</li>
    <li>The virtual computer model is used by Ethereum: It models the
      database as the in-memory state of a global computer with a single
      thread of execution determined by the block chain.</li>
    <li>In the UTXO model, as used in Bitcoin, the database is a set
      of immutable rows keyed by (hash:output index).  Transactions 
      define outputs that append new rows and inputs which consume
      existing rows.</li>
    <li>The term "smart contract" has a different meaning in each model. </li>

  Asynchronous Bizantine Fault Tolerant Consensus (Public BC)
<pre xxxsmall zoom>
- The Byzantine General’s Problem was first proposed by 
  SIFT in the 1970s to tolerate real-time faults in 
  commercial aircraft and then given the name by Lamport, 
  Shostak, and Pease in 1982. It described the problem of 
  achieving distributed agreement over a compromised 
  communications network — of making "a reliable system 
  from unreliable parts", as Ethan Buchman of Cosmos puts it.
  From 1982 to 1999, no one had invented a system that 
  solved the Byzantine General’s Problem. It was irrelevant 
  to computing for a long time because, at the time, the 
  internet had evolved out of cloud-based central computing;
  all that was needed was fault-tolerance.
  
- So, crash-fault tolerant algorithms like Paxos, invented 
  in the late 1980s, and Raft, invented in 2013, were 
  widely deployed. Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT
  ) was created in 1999, but was not really adopted by 
  anyone outside of academia. The breakthrough that Satoshi 
  Nakamoto made in 2008 was in bringing internet-scale 
  distributed Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT)consensus into 
  a blockchain scheme. Once that demonstration happened, a 
  lot of the people from the systems research community 
  started to formulate ideas around applying what was 
  largely an academic curiosity to a real-world application.


- (TX ordering) Consensus is very simple to implement in syncrhonous systems
  where a central ("God") server with a single internal timer takes care
  of ordering. Due to physical constraint (speed of light) it's not possible
  to establish a global time for distributed nodes  (CAP problem) so that
  all nodes agree at once about the timestamp of each TX generated "randomnly"
  (and asyncrhonously) by any node</li>
- consensus tries to solve the "P"artitioning problem in the CAP problem 
  to warrant all the network physically distributed nodes agree on the same state.
  This is done at the cost of the "A"vailability property, since
  A transaction (=="proposal to change the state") can be executed/mined fast, slow
  or "never".

  <li><b>X11</b>: uses 11 different rounds of hashes (hence the 11). Well received due
    to this incredibly energy-efficiency while mining with a GPU or CPU. This algorithm is
    also capable of keeping mining hardware a lot cooler as there is a lower requirement
    for processing power. This effectiveness also translated into lower operation costs due
    to less electricity being used.<br/>

  PoS (vs PoW) <a href="https://blog.cosmos.network/understanding-the-basics-of-a-proof-of-stake-security-model-de3b3e160710">REF</a>
<pre xxxsmall zoom>
PoS: First introduced in Tendermint by Jae Kwon, who, in 2014.
See also <a href="https://blog.cosmos.network/consensus-compare-casper-vs-tendermint-6df154ad56ae">The long road to Proof-of-Stake</a>

Stake: Assuming majority economic agents are not Byzantine 
    but rational, we can devise certain in-protocol incentives
    to modify decisions with determinism. The leveraging of 'stake'
    in Proof-of-Stake consensus provides stronger security guarantees 
    than Proof-of-Work consensus due to the bonding of collateralized
    capital, or security deposits. Utilizing this is so key to modern,
    fault tolerant PoS design, that the major protocols like Tendermint
    and Casper adopt security deposits at the core of their incentive
    mechanisms.
    <b>This is because stake that is bonded by a node which exhibits
    faulty behavior can be forfeit, or 'slashed', by the protocol.
    The protocol can therefore define some strong disincentive, or
    maximal penalty for incorrect behavior which can potentially far
    outweigh any transaction fees or mining rewards defined for 
    correct behavior.</b>

'Validators' as Security
    In Proof-of-Stake, the consensus nodes are known as validators,
    whereas in Proof-of-Work, they are known as miners. The term
    'bonded validator', or 'validator' for short, was first introduced
    by Jae Kwon in his pivotal white paper, Tendermint: Consensus
    without Mining. Each validator's voting power, or weight, amounts
    to the proportion of stake that's self-funded or allotted to them.
    All three of the aforementioned consensus protocols employ dynamic
    validator sets.

In many systems, not all validators will have the same "weight" in the
consensus protocol. Thus, we are not so much interested in 1/3 or 2/3
of the validators, but in those proportions of the total voting power,
which may not be uniformly distributed across individual validators.
So when you hear "2/3 or more" validators, what you’re really hearing
can be translated as "2/3 or more" of the deposit-weighted percentage
of the total deposit size of all validators in a set.

  <b>Non-Bizantine Fault Tolerant Consensus</b> (private/consorcium BCs)

  <li>PAXOS (NON bizantine tolerant)
    The best-known fault-tolerant consensus algorithm is Paxos;
    it was first published by Lamport  in  1998. Since then, many
    variations  have  been  developed  (e.g.Fast Paxos" ) so there
    is now a whole family of Paxos algorithms,  including some that
    are BFT<br/>
     Mike Burrows of Google (co-inventor of Google's Chubby,
    BigTable, and Dapper) has said,  "There is only one consensus protocol,
    and that's Paxos,"  [30] and all working protocols for asynchronous
    consensus we have so far encountered have Paxos at their
    core."<br/>
     Henry Robinson of Cloudera has said, "all other approaches are
    just broken versions of Paxos" and it's clear that a good consensus
    protocol is surprisingly hard to find."<br/>

    soft-forks can be implemented with merely a superemajority of the mining

  Demurrage (economics):
<pre xxxsmall zoom>
mechanism for achieving block rewards an idea pioneered for digital 
currency by Freicoin (http://freico.in) in which all unspent outputs lose 
value over time, with the lost value being recollected by miners. This 
keeps the currency supply stable while still rewarding miners. It may be 
better aligned with user interests than inflation because loss to demurrage
is enacted uniformly everywhere and instantaneously, unlike inflation; it 
also mitigates the possibility of long-unspent "lost" coins being reanimated
at their current valuation and shocking the economy, which is a perceived 
risk in Bitcoin. Demurrage creates incentives to increase monetary velocity
and lower interest rates, which are considered (e.g. by Freicoin advocates 
and other supporters of Silvio Gesell’s theory of interest[Ges16]) to be 
socially beneficial. In pegged sidechains, demurrage allows miners to be 
paid in existing already-valued currency

  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eventual_consistency">Eventual consistency</a>
<pre xxxsmall zoom>
 is a consistency model used in distributed computing to 
achieve high availability that informally guarantees that
, if no new updates are made to a given data item, 
eventually all accesses to that item will return the last 
updated value.[1] Eventual consistency, also called 
optimistic replication,[2] is widely deployed in 
distributed systems, and has origins in early mobile 
computing projects.[3] A system that has achieved 
eventual consistency is often said to have converged, or 
achieved replica convergence.[4] Eventual consistency is 
a weak guarantee – most stronger models, like 
linearizability are trivially eventually consistent, but 
a system that is merely eventually consistent does not 
usually fulfill these stronger constraints.  Eventually-
consistent services are often classified as providing 
BASE (Basically Available, Soft state, Eventual 
consistency) semantics, in contrast to traditional ACID (
Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) guarantees
.[5][6] Eventual consistency is sometimes criticized[7] 
as increasing the complexity of distributed software 
applications. This is partly because eventual consistency 
is purely a liveness guarantee (reads eventually return 
the same value) and does not make safety guarantees: an 
eventually consistent system can return any value before 
it converges.

  Pegged" Side Chains</b>
<pre xxxsmall zoom>
  Technology enabling the atomic movement of assets between blockchains.
  <a href="https://www.blockstream.com/sidechains.pdf">Whitepaper</a>
  Multiple  Independent  Chains  with  Shared  Resources  for  Security.
    Pegged sidechains are the most famous example, where mining among chains
    has the efect of being merged [83].  SuperNET [96] and Ethereum's hypercubes
    and multichain proposals [97]  fit in this category. However, if the goal
    is simply to get a DB to run at scale, breaking the DB into many 
    heterogeneous sub-chains adds cognitive and engineering complexity
    and introduces risk.
  """Proposed solution: In order to transfer asset provide proof/s of possesion
      in the transferrring TXs themselves, avoiding the need for nodes to track
      the sending chain. On a high level, when moving assets from one blockchain to
      anothers, we create a TXs on the first (parente) blockchain locking the assets,
      then create a TXs on the second (side) blockchain whose inputs contain a 
      cryptographic proof that the lock was done correctly. These inputs are
      tagged with an asset type, e.g, the genesis hash of its originating blockchain"""

  <b>Sidechain</b> is a blockchain that validates data from other blockchains

  <b>Two-way peg</b>: Mechanism by which coins are transferred between sidechains
      and back at a fixed or otherwise deterministic exchange rate.

  DMMS: Dynamic membership multi-party signature: Signature formed by a set of
      signers which has no fixed size. Bitcoin's blockheaders can be considered
      DMMSes because their proof-of-work has the property that anyone can contribute
      with no enrolment process

  <b>Simplified payment verification proof(SPV)</b> is a DMMS that an action 
      occurred on a Bitcoin-kie proof-of-work blockchain

  To transfer parent chain coins into sidechain coins, the parent chain coins are
    sent to a special output on the parent chain that can only be unlocked by an SPV
    proof of possession on the sidechain. To sync the two chains two waiting periods
    are needed:
    - <b>Confirmation period</b> of a transfer between sidechains: duration for which a coin
        must be locked on the parent chain before it can be transferred to the sidechain,
        allowing for sufficient work to be created sucha that a denial of service attack
        in the next waiting period becomes more difficult (around 1 or 2 days).
        The user waits for the conf. period, then creates a TX on the sidechain refering
        to this output, providing an SPV proof that it was created and "buried" under
        sufficient work on the parent chain.
    - <b>Contest period</b> delta-time in which a newly-transferred coin main
        not be spent on the sidechain in order to prevent double-spending by transferring
        previously-locked coins during a reorganization. ("in the order of one/two days)
    - While locked on the parent chain, the coin can be freely transferred within 
        the sidechain without  further interaction with the parent chain. However, it 
        retains its identity as a parent chain coin, and can only be transferred 
        back to the same chain that it came from.
    - Transfering coinx back from the side chain to the parent chain follows the
        same procedure: send the sidechain coins to an SPV-locked output, produce a 
        sufficient SPV proof that this was done, and use the proof to unlock a number
        of previosly-locked outputs with equal denomination on the parent chain.

  Payment Channels
<pre xxxsmall zoom>
(<a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-guide#micropayment-channel">Ref@bitcoin.org</a>)

- class of techniques designed to allow two "peers" to make multiple transactions
   without commiting all of the transactions to the block chain.

- Ussually only two transactions are commited, the first one to "open" the
  bilateral channel between peers (adding liquidity to the channel) and the second
  one to "close" the offchain set of signed transaction to the blockchain (with the
  last aggreed balance for the channel)

<b><a href="http://lightning.network/">Lightning Network</a></b>
  - Security is enforced by blockchain smart-contracts without creating a 
    on-blockchain transaction for individual payments. Payment speed measured 
    in milliseconds to seconds.
  - Scalability. Capable of millions to billions of transactions per second
    across the network.
  - Capacity blows away legacy payment rails by many orders of magnitude.
    Attaching payment per action/click is now possible without custodians.
  - Low Cost. By transacting and settling off-blockchain, the Lightning Network 
    allows for exceptionally low fees, which allows for emerging use cases such 
    as instant micropayments.
  - Cross Blockchains. Cross-chain atomic swaps can occur off-chain instantly 
    with heterogeneous blockchain consensus rules. So long as the chains can 
    support the same cryptographic hash function, it is possible to make 
    transactions across blockchains without trust in 3rd party custodians.

  - A horizontal, usually underground stem that often sends out roots and shoots from its nodes.
      - RSK is the first open-source smart contract platform with a 2-way peg
        to Bitcoin that also rewards the Bitcoin miners via merge-mining, allowing 
        them to actively participate in the Smart Contract revolution. RSK goal
        is to add value and functionality to the Bitcoin ecosystem by enabling
        smart-contracts, near instant payments and higher-scalability.
      - The project has been conceived with the following principles in mind: Bitcoin Friendly:
        We believe in Bitcoin. We support the Bitcoin community and we want to
        continue the legacy of Bitcoin´s pioneers. The lack of turing-complete
        smart-contracts capabilities may become an obstacle to Bitcoin´s growth 
        to it´s full potential. RSK provides the missing technical needs, as a
        blockchain with a 2way peg to Bitcoin. As RSK does not mint, nor has
        pre-mined coins, then it has no speculative value and does not compete
        with Bitcoin.

- Scalable network of blockchains.
    
"third-generation" public <b>permissionless</b> blockchain technology
designed to be at once scalable and extensible, solving two of the
greatest problems preventing widespread adoption of blockchain technology
today.
    
"""With the goal of allowing diverse kinds of blockchains to 
 interoperate within the same consensus network, we can enable a new level of 
 freedom and protection. Innovative new technologies can be quickly integrated
 , and divisive hard forks can become a thing of the past.
 ... it has the potential to integrate so called "private" chains into
the same consensus network as public chains like Ethereum - while still
retaining their privacy and permissioned safeguards. It gives us a new
transactive layer potentially linking hundreds of blockchains to one
another." 
    
 - Polkadot has been designated to include a backwards-compatibility
layer with the current Ethereum network, allowing smart contracts on
Ethereum to interact directly with any chains that become a part
of Polkadot network.

   Characterizing Payments in Bitcoin
<pre xxxsmall zoom>
<a href="http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~smeiklejohn/files/imc13.pdf">Ref</a>
Bitcoin is a purely online virtual currency, unbacked by either phys-
ical  commodities  or  sovereign  obligation;  instead,  it  relies  on  a
combination of cryptographic protection and a peer-to-peer proto-
col for witnessing settlements.  Consequently, Bitcoin has the un-
intuitive property that while the ownership of money is implicitly
anonymous, its flow is globally visible.  In this paper we explore
this unique characteristic further, using heuristic clustering to group
Bitcoin wallets based on evidence of shared authority, and then us-
ing re-identification attacks (i.e., empirical purchasing of goods and
services) to classify the operators of those clusters. From this anal-
ysis,  we characterize longitudinal changes in the Bitcoin market,
the stresses these changes are placing on the system, and the chal-
lenges for those seeking to use Bitcoin for criminal or fraudulent
purposes at scale.

  <a href="http://www.jgriffin.info/papers/">Is Bitcoin Really Un-Tethered?</a>
<pre xxxsmall zoom>
This paper investigates whether Tether, a digital 
currency pegged to U.S.  dollars, influences Bitcoin and 
other cryptocurrency prices during the recent boom. Using 
algorithms to analyze the blockchain data, we find that 
purchases with Tether are timed following market 
downturns and result in sizable increases in Bitcoin 
prices. Less than 1% of hours with such heavy Tether 
transactions are associated with 50% of the meteoric rise 
in Bitcoin and 64% of other top cryptocurrencies. The 
flow clusters below round prices, induces asymmetric 
autocorrelations in Bitcoin, and suggests incomplete 
Tether backing before month-ends. These patterns cannot 
be explained by investor demand proxies but are most 
consistent with the supply-based hypothesis where Tether 
is used to provide price support and manipulate 
cryptocurrency prices.

"""
We have long recognized that in order for cryptocurrency 
to reach mass adoption, a form of cryptocurrency that has 
higher price stability than existing cryptocurrencies 
like BTC and ETH would be needed so that people can use 
the currency to store funds and engage in commerce 
without worrying about their monthly salary dropping by 57
% between the time they receive it and the time they can 
use the money to buy products. Unfortunately, we’ve found 
that the existing stablecoins all have various flaws; 
Tether is unauditable, Nubits has already once collapsed 
in price, Seignorage Shares is after three years still 
just a whitepaper and MakerDAO is an inadequate joke 
because…. reasons. As a result, we’ve decided to take 
matters into our own hands, and issue our own officially 
branded stablecoin, and use this as an opportunity to 
make another ICO"""

  Ex.Exchange attacks:
<pre xxxsmall zoom>
   """In the past few weeks, we’ve seen reports of consensus attacks on large crypto projects such 
  as Verge (XVG) and Bitcoin Gold (BTG). We faced some consensus attacks as well. These attacks are 
  known as double-spends. Here’s how they work:

1) An attacker sends a transaction.

2) The attacker mines blocks on a chain with his/her own 
or rented hashpower (usually by forking off), but refuses 
to broadcast these blocks on the network. These blocks do 
not contain his/her original transaction from step 1.

3) The attacker’s transaction is confirmed on a service (
like an exchange), so he/she gets credited for the 
transaction.

4) The attacker broadcasts the blocks on the network, 
erasing the existence of his or her transaction. Now he 
or she has been credited coins on the service he/she sent 
to and he/she still has the coins.

Our new Komodo notarization feature greatly reduces the 
impact of such an attack. Komodo notaries are running 
GameCredits clients and monitoring the network 24/7/365. 
At a certain interval of blocks, these notaries get the 
hash of a block and write it into the Komodo chain. They 
also note down which Komodo block has the notarization 
within the GameCredits chain."""

(Extracted from "Hands-on BC with Hyperledger") 
 - Auditing and logging: To help addressing 
   regulations for the purposes of non-repudiation, 
   technology root cause analysis, fraud analysis, and other 
   enterprise needs.
 - Integration with existing DDBBs:
   (CRM, business intelligence, reporting and analytics...)
 - Monitoring: Monitoring is an important capability for 
   addressing regulations and ensuring high availability, 
   capacity planning, pattern recognition, and fault 
   identification.
 - Enterprise authentication, authorization, and 
   accounting requirements: In the enterprise 
   world, all blockchain network participants should
   be identified and tracked. Their roles need to be
   defined if they are to play a part in the ecosystem.

    We track Bitcoins, Dollars, Euros, Pounds and Yen, Sports Results, Personal Goals ("Did Alice completed its task?"),
    We track GPS data from any RunKeeper user who gives us permission.
    Anything in the Universe
    You can follow any proposition you can construct using WikiData.
    WikiData replaces our previous FreeBase data source, which has been discontinued by Google.
    """ We can easily add new data sources based on publicly-available APIs.
    Coming Soon:
    Realitio, Our new Ethereum-based crowd-sourced smart contract oracle system,
       allows any your contract to ask any question that can be answered by humans."""
    
  **HOW IT WORKS**
    - Register an event to track using public API.
    - We issue two Reality Keys ™, one for Yes and one for No. 
    - We keep the private keys and publish the public keys,
       which you can use to create an encrypted message or a Bitcoin contract.
    - For users of Ethereum and other advanced smart contract platforms,
      we provide a hash that will identify the result, and an address
      that we will use to sign it.
    - We wait until the date you specified when you created the fact.
    - We perform an automated check against the appropriate API and publish the result.
    - In the event that anyone thinks the result from the API was wrong, 
      they can pay us a fee and a human will double-check.
      Otherwise the result provided by the API will stand.
    - We publish the private key for the winning result. 
      You can use it to decrypt your message or complete a
      Bitcoin contract. The private key for the losing result is never released.
    - We also sign the value (either true/false or the value of
      the data we find) with our Ethereum address, allowing it to be used in an Ethereum contract.
