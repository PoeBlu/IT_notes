  <ul>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map" target="_new">Mind maps</a> are great at displaying 
  related topics toghether ("bird's eye view") but they fail to provide concrete information 
  about the topics themself</li>

  <li><a target="_new" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheat_sheet">Cheat-sheets</a> are great at providing 
    daily-usage for a given tool, procedure, task, ... but fail to provide the global mind-map picture
    in a bigger context</li>

  <li>Books are great for learning purposes but they are "bloated" with educational content
    that is not very useful in repeated reads ("experts consults") and not very conformtable to
    work with for daily use, specially when we just want to query some "how-to" time-to-time.<br/>
    This is worse with electronic book formats like PDFs, WORDs or e-books since moving around is quite 
    un-confortable on computer screens when compared to printed paper.
  </li>
  </ul>
  
  The Single-Page-Book format (SPB) try to fix those shortcommings providing the 
  best of all worlds.<br/>
   <ul>
  <li>A (properly written) single-page-book will offer all the advantages of mind-maps,
  cheat-sheats and books.</li>
  <li>SPBs will allow to store <b>as much information as possible no more than one click away</b>
  avoiding random searchs in Google/cheat-seats/emails/blogs/crystal balls/...
  </li>
  <li>
  Single-Page-book pretend to be to documentation what
  <a target="_new" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application">single-page-apps</a> became for web apps.<br/>
  </li>
  <li>The content "dynamically" allows to zoom in/out of the content with easy,
     (Something like similar to how a user will navigate in Google Maps)
  </li>
  </ul>
    To make it possible SPB profits from all the excelent work invested in modern
  Web Browsers to provide static and dynamic content:<br/>
  A modern browser can parse and render tens of megabytes of HTML per second,
  and Internet connection is fast enough to play video, so loading page-by-page
  does not make sense anymore.  The cost of a new page requests is much higher
  than the cost of keeping evering in memory.  Also offline navigation comes for
  free.
  <br/>
   Current web sites (and electronic book formats) follow the page-by-page
  inherited from printed-paper. Actually being able to zoom in/out "a la Google
  Maps" provides a much confortable UI in electronic devices. Starting from a zoom-out
  and arranging content properly provides a mind-map of the information for free.
  <br/>
  In practice a SPB book is just a single web page profiting from a thoroughly 
  dessigned CSS and some helper Javascript.<br/>
  WARN: The CSS follows the VIM philosophy: <b>"Fast is more important than beauty"</b>:<br/>
  
  The SPB format can also be used for many other purposes that I did not contemplated
  when starting the project.<br/>
   As an example I'm using a SPB formated page as my <b>browser home-page to store all sort 
  of "random" things</b> like contacts, bookmarks, projects, work-in-progress, task-lists,
  pending payments, home accountancy, travel-management, medical data, project-management,
  resource-planning, english and french vocabulary, etc ... <br/>
   A moderm text-editor is all that needed to keep the info up-to-date
  and accesible with one click.  vim, notepad++, ultraedit, ... or any other
  with support for macros is all that needed (and of course web browser).
  <br/>

  Indirectly <b>SPB promote "best-pattern" approach to documentation</b> by:
  <ul>
  <li>Putting related info close to each other. Actually a single html text file will be used.</li>
  <li>Don't repeat twice. This is easier once the previously spread information is 
      located in a single file.</li>
  <li>Don't keep notes spread(hidden) amongst hundred of emails.</li>
  <li>Don't hide important information digged behind random menus paths 
      and children pages:<br/>
      <b>The risk of the Unknown Unknowns</b> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_are_known_knowns">(Wikipedia entry)</a>) 
      can also be applied to documentation:<br/>
      <b>People will not search for important information until they are aware that such important
      information exists</b>, so we better place important information right into the main page.<br/>
  </li>
  <li>Don't use propietary formats for important documentation: <br/>
      HTML will be well supported in any electronic platform and by many
      different working groups for always, propiertary formats will not.<br/>
      The tag language used by HTML is plain human-readable text, which make of it
      an even better standard.
  </li>
  <li>Check quickly what rest to be documented.<b>This will automatically save many
       disputes at work:</b><br/>
       ""You know it was not documented and everybody knows that you knew it, and 
        you know that everyone else knew that you knew it, ..."""
  </li>
  </ul>
<p>

<h2>What the SPB IS NOT:</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>SPB is NOT a Content Management System or any other type of software. <br/>
      There is a minimum Javascript and CSS to help displaying content in a (very) pragmatical way.</li>
  <li><b>SPB is to HTML formating what vim is to text-editors: Not-pretty but fast and efficient</b><br/>
      In fact the SPB is "allergic" to pretty-formatting following the next experimental fact:<br/>
      - <b>"pretty-to-see" documentation is "uggly-to-work-with" documentation</b>. Just some links
        supporting this point-of-view focusing on the well-known "pretty-to-see" Power Point:
        <p style="font-family: monospace;">

        </li>
        </ol>
        </p>
   </li>
  </ul>
<br/>


<h2>How does it Compares to:</h2>
<ul>
    <li><b>Note taking apps like Evernote:</b><br/>
        Evernote (and others) are high-level user visual apps.
        They use some form of propietary database format
        to store the content and propietary services to synchronize the
        content. <br/>
        On the other side SPB follows the phylosophy that the database formal
        must be as simple as possible. Actually is plain html (that's, text files).
        This makes of it a much less friendly app for newcommers, but allows
        to reuse many powerfull tools like git, different text editors, or
        synchronization mechanisms.<br/>
        The application itself reduces to the embedded Javascript.<br/> 
        It also allows for "complex" things like embedding SVG images,
        videos, iframes or any other technology supported by modern browsers,
        or extend it with standard javascript.<br/>
        Probably normal users will be happie enough with Evernote while
        advanced users who feel confortable with text editors and git
        will prefer the SPB format.
   </li>
   <li><b><a hre="https://learnxinyminutes.com/" target="_new">Learn X in Y Minutes</a></b>
       "alike" sites.<br/>
       Learn X in Y minutes (and others like <a href="https://cheat.sh">cheat.sh</a>
       have surged to create a "learn-fast" path for newcomers. They make a great
       job for what they have been designed. Still they will fail once we try
       to get deeper into any complex technology and they don't provide tooling
       like "search-by-topic" in SPB. Learning data-science or IA or modern
       language programming is not about one cheat-sheet, but about many 
       inter-related ones.<br/>
       SPB can be used to create a better "learn X in Y minutes". <br/>
       This is how learn x in y minutes :
       <a href="https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/java/" target="_new">presents java to newcomers</a> and this is how SPB 
       <a href="JAVA/java_map.html" target="_new">presents java to newcomers and seniors developers</a>
   </li>
   <li><b>Zettelkasten knowledge and info management</b>.<br/>
       <a href="https://www.qwant.com/?q=Zettelkastenw&t=web">Zettlekasten</a> follows a set of
       patterns for advanced documention and note-taking.<br/>
       Actually SPB do not compares to, but can be used as a way for "Zettelkasten"ing.<br/>
       Some tools have been developed. With SPB, the tool is your browser!.<br/>
       Actually "Zettelkasten"ers looks to like the SPB format according to
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Zettelkasten/">some comments in reddit</a>.
