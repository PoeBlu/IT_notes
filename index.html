<h1>Welcome to the Single-Page-Book Project</h1>

  <ul>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map" target="_new">Mind maps</a> are great at displaying 
  related topics toghether ("bird's eye view") but they fail to provide concrete information 
  about the topics themself</li>

  <li><a target="_new" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheat_sheet">Cheat-sheets</a> are great at providing 
    daily-usage for a given tool, procedure, task, ... but fail to provide the global mind-map picture
    in a bigger context</li>

  <li>Books are great for learning purposes but they are "bloated" with educational content
    that is not very useful in repeated reads ("experts consults") and not very conformtable to
    work with for daily use, specially when we just want to query some "how-to" time-to-time.<br/>
    This is worse with electronic book formats like PDFs, WORDs or e-books since moving around is quite 
    un-confortable on computer screens when compared to printed paper.
  </li>
  </ul>
  
  The Single-Page-Book format (SPB) try to fix those shortcommings providing the 
  best of all worlds.<br/>
   <ul>
  <li>A (properly written) single-page-book will offer all the advantages of mind-maps,
  cheat-sheats and books.</li>
  <li>SPBs will allow to store <b>as much information as possible no more than one click away</b>
  avoiding random searchs in Google/cheat-seats/emails/blogs/crystal balls/...
  </li>
  <li>
  Single-Page-book pretend to be to documentation what
  <a target="_new" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application">single-page-apps</a> became for web apps.<br/>
  </li>
  <li>The content "dynamically" allows to zoom in/out of the content with easy,
     (Something like similar to how a user will navigate in Google Maps)
  </li>
  </ul>
    To make it possible SPB profits from all the excelent work invested in modern
  Web Browsers to provide static and dynamic content:<br/>
  A modern browsers can parse and render tens of megabytes of HTML per second,
  and Internet connection is fast enough to play video, so loading page-by-page
  does not make sense anymore.  The cost of a new page requests is much higher
  than the cost of keeping evering in memory.  Also offline navigation comes for
  free.
  <br/>
   Current web sites (and electronic book formats) follow the page-by-page
  inherited from printed-paper. Actually being able to zoom in/out "a la Google
  Maps provides a much confortable UI in electronic devices. Starting from a zoom-out
  and arranging content properly provides a mind-map of the information for free.
  <br/>
  In practice a SPB book is just a single web page profiting from a thoroughly 
  dessigned CSS and some helper Javascript.<br/>
  WARN: The CSS It follows the VIM philosophy: <b>"Fast is more important than beauty"</b>:<br/>
  
  The SPB format can also be used for many other purposes that I did not contemplated
  when starting the project.<br/>
   As an example <b>I'm using a SPB formated page as my browser home-page to store all sort of 
  "random" info like contacts, bookmarks, projects, work-in-progress, task-lists,
  pending payments, home accountancy, travel-management, medical data, project-management,
  resource-planning, english and french vocabulary (I'm spanish actually), etc ...</b> and
  I'm <b>using just an text-editor</b> (vim, notepad++, ultraedit, ...) to keep the info up-to-date
  and accesible with one click<br/>
  <br/>

  Indirectly SPB promote "best-pattern" approach to documentation by:
  <ul>
  <li>Putting related info close to each other. Actually a single html text file will be used.</li>
  <li>Don't repeat same info twice. This is easier once the previously spread information is located in a single file</li>
  <li>Don't keep notes spread(hidden) amongst hundred of emails</li>
  <li>Don't hide important information inside random menus paths and children pages:<br/>
      The risk of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_are_known_knowns">Unknown Unknowns</a> can
      also be applied to documentation:<br/>
      People will not search for important information until they are aware that such important information
      exists, so better place important information right into the main page.<br/>
  </li>
  </ul>
<p>

<h2>SPB HOW-TO:</h2>
  To create your single-page-book project all that needed is to reuse 
  the <a target="_new" href="https://github.com/earizon/IT_notes/blob/master/map_v1.js">(minimum) javascript</a>,
  the <a target="_new" href="https://github.com/earizon/IT_notes/blob/master/map_v1.css">css</a> 
  and the <a target="_new" href="./map_template.html">html template</a> plus some minimum experience with HTML document writing.<br/>
  Dont' forget to have a look at the <a target="_new" href="demo.html"><b>demo</b></a> for a quick look a different possibilities.
</p>
<br/>

<h2>What the SPB IS NOT:</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>SPB is NOT a Content Management System or any other type of software. <br/>
      There is a minimum Javascript and CSS to help displaying content in a (very) pragmatical way.</li>
  <li><b>SPB is to HTML formating what vim is to text-editors: Not-pretty but fast and efficient</b><br/>
      In fact the SPB is "allergic" to pretty-formatting following the next experimental fact:<br/>
      - <b>"pretty-to-see" documentation is "uggly-to-work-with" documentation</b>. Just some links
        supporting this point-of-view focusing on the well-known "pretty-to-see" PowerPoint:

<h3>Current list of Single Page Books:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Next follow a list of example single-page-books I've created while working on different topics.<br/>
 The quality varies from "intention to create something" to "useful for daily work" based on the time
 spent and my own experience on each topic.
 <ol>
 <li>alpha or draft state means just the intention to do some work in the future.</li>
 <li>Beta state means that related information is in place, but information is still missing or non-validated.</li>
 <li>Version 1.0 or higher means that content can be used as reference (In my personal experience,
    now I have to visit Google much less frequently while programing with Java/Kotlin or
    doing linux administrative work) 
 </li> 
 </ol>
</li>
