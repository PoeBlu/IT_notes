  <ul>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map" target="_new">Mind maps</a> are great at displaying 
  related topics toghether ("bird's eye view") but they fail to provide concrete information 
  about the topics themself</li>

  <li><a target="_new" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheat_sheet">Cheat-sheats</a> are great at providing 
    daily-usage for a given tool, procedure, task, ... but fail to provide the global mind-map picture
    in a bigger context</li>

  <li>Books are great for learning purposes but they are "bloated" with educational content
    that is not very useful in repeated reads ("experts consults") and not very conformtable to
    work with for daily use, specially when we just want to query some "how-to" time-to-time.<br/>
    This is worse with electronic book formats  pdfs or ebooks since moving around is quite 
    un-confortable on computer screens when compared to printed paper.
  </li>
  </ul>
  
  The Single-Page-Book format (SPB) try to fix those shortcommings providing the 
  best of all worlds.<br/>
  A (properly written) single-page-book will offer all the advantages of mind-maps,
  cheat-sheats and books.<br/>

  Single-Page-book pretend to be to documentation what
  <a target="_new" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application">single-page-apps</a> became for web apps.<br/>
  While the content is saved, transported and stored in a single document similar to an e-book or pdf, it can be consulted and a much higher pace, "dynamically" allowing to zoom in/out of the content with easy. <br/>
  <br/>
  To make it possible SPB profits from all the excelent work invested in modern
  Web Browsers to provide static and dynamic content<br/>
  In practice a SPB book is just a single web page profiting from a thoroughly 
  dessigned <a target="_new" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets">CSS</a> and some helper Javascript.<br/>
   The CSS has been designed to be extreme-responsive to any screen size, mouse or
  touch-screen.  Nevertheless a desktop with a modern tiling window manager like 
  <a target="_new" href="https://i3wm.org/">i3</a> and a 28" monitor will make a more pleasent experience<br/>

  On Firefox  the <a target="_new" href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-reader-view-clutter-free-web-pages">reader view switch</a>
  can also be used to have an start-to-end "book-alike" read<br/>

  The SPB format can also be used for many free purposes like "zipping" in a 
  single page hundreds of
  <a target="_new" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snippet_(programming)">code-snippets</a>,
  <a target="_new" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_diagram">Sequence diagrams</a>, 
  contacts, resources, links, ...<br/>
  
  The final purpose is to provide a mechanism to have <b>as much information as possible on a set of topics no
  more than one click away</b> avoiding "Google searchs", "randomnly located cheat-seats/emails/..." for daily tasks.<br/>

  Indirectly SPB promote "best-pattern" approach to documentation by:
  <ul>
  <li>Putting related info close to each other. Actually a single html text file will be used.</li>
  <li>Don't repeat same info twice. This is easier once the previously spread information is located in a single file</li>
  <li>Don't keep notes spread(hidden) amongst hundred of emails</li>
  <li>Don't hide important info down a million of menus and child pages. People will not search for important 
     information until they are aware that such important information exists, so better place important information
     in the main page</li>
  </ul>
<p>
<h2>SPB HOW-TO:</h2>
  To create your single-page-book project all that needed is to reuse 
  the <a target="_new" href="https://github.com/earizon/IT_notes/blob/master/map_v1.js">(minimum) javascript</a>,
  the <a target="_new" href="https://github.com/earizon/IT_notes/blob/master/map_v1.css">css</a> 
  and the <a target="_new" href="./map_template.html">html template</a> plus some minimum experience with HTML document writing.<br/>
  Dont' forget to have a look at the <a target="_new" href="demo.html"><b>demo</b></a> for a quick look a different possibilities.

<h3>Current list of Mind-maps:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Next follow a list of example single-page-books I created while working on different topics. The quality varies, based on the time spent and my own experience on each topic.</li>
<li>Beta state means that related information is in place, but things are still missing/non-validated</li>
<li>Version 1.0 or higher means that content on the  be used as a reference book, mind map or quick-sheet in daily work</li>
