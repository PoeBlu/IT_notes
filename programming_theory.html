  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_tree#PATRICIA
  Donald R. Morrison first described what he called "Patricia trees" in 1968;[4] the name comes from the acronym PATRICIA, which stands for "Practical Algorithm To Retrieve Information Coded In Alphanumeric". Gernot Gwehenberger independently invented and described the data structure at about the same time.[5] PATRICIA trees are radix trees with radix equals 2, which means that each bit of the key is compared individually and each node is a two-way (i.e., left versus right) branch.

Term                    Meaning
Functional diagram      Structured representation of the functions (activities, actions, processes, operations) within the system or one of its parts.
                        The model aims at facilitating the identification of information needs and helping to recognize opportunities.
Component diagram       Diagram which has the purpose of representing the internal structure of the software system modeled in terms of its main components and the relationships between them. 
                        A component is a software unit with a distinct identity, as well as a distinct responsibility and well-defined interfaces.
Deployment diagram      Diagram which describes a system in terms of hardware resources, nodes, and relationships between them.
                        Often there is a diagram showing how the software components are distributed in the available hardware resources on the system.
                        In essence, it shows the physical location (deployment) of components of the architecture
Activity diagram        The process view is a way of showing what the system does at a high level 
                        from a process prospective, explaining how the small steps within the process fit together, in terms of order and information flow.
Use case diagram        Diagram representing the actors outside of a system capable of interacting with the system itself. It represents the highest level view of a system.  
                        Shows the system as a whole and its input and output to and from external elements.

JIRA:
- Agile concepts
- Jira Agile Plan, Work, Track
- Jira Issues & Dashboards
---------------------------------
- Agile concepts:

  - Projects takes too much (1 year taking requirements, 10 months
developping,...)

  - Agile applies to project, people relationships,...
    prioritization of tasks, ...
    better visibility
    better prioritization
    less downtime between tasks
    Improved teamwork

  - What's a task:
    A case study / promo-video / market-research /... ? NO. Too long.
    A task in agile is something that takes more than 30 minutes and less 
    than 3 days.

  - How to estimate the time?
    Estimating is hard.
    Use story points (vs hours):
        1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 48
        This could map (not necesarely) to:
        30min, 1hour, 2hours, 4hours, 1day, 2days, 3days.

SCRUM vs KANBAN: 
  Both are subsets of Agile.
  SCRUM targets dead-lines. (fixed dates)
   * Releases are more important that "what's in".
   * Delay release or drop feature?
   * Uses a PLAN MODE

  Kanban:
   * Service team. new tickets  always comming in.
   * Prioritazing the tickets (tasks) and doing in the right order
     is more important than how many are done in a week.
   * No Plan mode, no Sprints. 
     PLAN MODE:
   * Do NOT uses a PLAN MODE



SCRUM: 
  STEP 1: 
  Initialy a set of tasks is created and added to the backlog ("TODO list")
  Not necesarelly the tasks to  do now. (Maybe some of them will be planned
  to start in two years time.
  STEP 2: 
  Decide if we need EPICs. (Team of work/tasks)
  STEP 3: 
  Create a new batch of tasks (SPRINT) and decide which tasks to move from
  the backlog to the SPRINT.
  Note: usually a sprint is two week.
  For every sprint we can decide to move forward one or more epics.

JIRA WORKFLOW SUMMARIZED:
  - We have a team of developers than pass the work to the QA Team that
  pass the work back to the developers or forwards it to the client,...
  - There can be "millions" of different workflows.

BURNDOWN: Is the chart showing the progress for the sprint.
  (The line that shows linear progress vs real progress)


JIRA ISSUES and DASHBOARDS:
   - Dashboards allows for example to follow  others people work.
