ABIDIFF

ABIDIFF(1)                       Libabigail                       ABIDIFF(1)

NAME         top

       abidiff - compare ABIs of ELF files

       abidiff  compares  the  Application  Binary  Interfaces  (ABI) of two
       shared libraries  in  ELF  format.   It  emits  a  meaningful  report
       describing the differences between the two ABIs.

       This  tool can also compare the textual representations of the ABI of
       two ELF binaries (as emitted by abidw) or an  ELF  binary  against  a
       textual representation of another ELF binary.

       For  a  comprehensive  ABI  change report that includes changes about
       function and variable sub-types, the two input shared libraries  must
       be  accompanied with their debug information in DWARF format.  Other‐
       wise, only ELF symbols that were added or removed are reported.

INVOCATION         top

          abidiff [options] <first-shared-library> <second-shared-library>

ENVIRONMENT         top

       abidiff loads two default suppression specifications files, merges
       their content and use it to filter out ABI change reports that might
       be considered as false positives to users.

       · Default system-wide suppression specification file

         It's located by the optional environment variable
         LIBABIGAIL_DEFAULT_SYSTEM_SUPPRESSION_FILE.  If that environment
         variable is not set, then abidiff tries to load the suppression
         file $libdir/libabigail/libabigail-default.abignore.  If that file
         is not present, then no default system-wide suppression
         specification file is loaded.

       · Default user suppression specification file.

         It's located by the optional environment
         LIBABIGAIL_DEFAULT_USER_SUPPRESSION_FILE.  If that environment
         variable is not set, then abidiff tries to load the suppression
         file $HOME/.abignore.  If that file is not present, then no default
         user suppression specification is loaded.

OPTIONS         top

          · --help | -h

            Display a short help about the command and exit.

          · --version | -v

            Display the version of the program and exit.

          · --debug-info-dir1 | --d1 <di-path1>

            For cases where the debug information for first-shared-library
            is split out into a separate file, tells abidiff where to find
            that separate debug information file.

            Note that di-path must point to the root directory under which
            the debug information is arranged in a tree-like manner.  Under
            Red Hat based systems, that directory is usually
            <root>/usr/lib/debug.

            Note also that this option is not mandatory for split debug
            information installed by your system's package manager because
            then abidiff knows where to find it.

          · --debug-info-dir2 | --d2 <di-path2>

            Like --debug-info-dir1, this options tells abidiff where to find
            the split debug information for the second-shared-library file.

          · --headers-dir1 | --hd1 <headers-directory-path-1>

            Specifies where to find the public headers of the first shared
            library that the tool has to consider.  The tool will thus
            filter out ABI changes on types that are not defined in public
            headers.

          · --headers-dir2 | --hd2 <headers-directory-path-1>

            Specifies where to find the public headers of the second shared
            library that the tool has to consider.  The tool will thus
            filter out ABI changes on types that are not defined in public
            headers.

          · --no-linux-kernel-mode

            Without this option, if abidiff detects that the binaries it is
            looking at are Linux Kernel binaries (either vmlinux or modules)
            then it only considers functions and variables which ELF symbols
            are listed in the __ksymtab and __ksymtab_gpl sections.

            With this option, abidiff considers the binary as a non-special
            ELF binary.  It thus considers functions and variables which are
            defined and exported in the ELF sense.

          · --kmi-whitelist | -kaw <path-to-whitelist>

            When analyzing a Linux kernel binary, this option points to the
            white list of names of ELF symbols of functions and variables
            which ABI must be considered.  That white list is called a
            "Kernel Module Interface white list".  This is because for the
            Kernel, we don't talk about ABI; we rather talk about the
            interface between the Kernel and its module. Hence the term KMI
            rather than ABI.

            Any other function or variable which ELF symbol are not present
            in that white list will not be considered by this tool.

            If this option is not provided -- thus if no white list is
            provided -- then the entire KMI, that is, the set of all
            publicly defined and exported functions and global variables by
            the Linux Kernel binaries, is considered.

          · --drop-private-types

            This option is to be used with the --headers-dir1 and
            --headers-dir2 options.  With this option, types that are NOT
            defined in the headers are entirely dropped from the internal
            representation build by Libabigail to represent the ABI.  They
            thus don't have to be filtered out from the final ABI change
            report because they are not even present in Libabigail's
            representation.

            Without this option however, those private types are kept in the
            internal representation and later filtered out from the report.

            This options thus potentially makes Libabigail consume less
            memory.  It's meant to be mainly used to optimize the memory
            consumption of the tool on binaries with a lot of publicly
            defined and exported types.

            The typical output of abidiff when comparing two binaries looks
            like this

                $ abidiff libtest-v0.so libtest-v1.so
                Functions changes summary: 0 Removed, 1 Changed, 0 Added function
                Variables changes summary: 0 Removed, 0 Changed, 0 Added variable

                1 function with some indirect sub-type change:

                  [C]'function void fn(C&)' at test-v1.cc:13:1 has some indirect sub-type changes:
                    parameter 1 of type 'C&' has sub-type changes:
                      in referenced type 'struct C' at test-v1.cc:7:1:
                        type size hasn't changed
                        1 data member change:
                         type of 'leaf* C::m0' changed:
                           in pointed to type 'struct leaf' at test-v1.cc:1:1:
                             type size changed from 32 to 64 bits
                             1 data member insertion:
                               'char leaf::m1', at offset 32 (in bits) at test-v1.cc:4:1

                $

            So in that example the report emits information about how the
            data member insertion change of "struct leaf" is reachable from
            function "void fn(C&)".  In other words, the report not only
            shows the data member change on "struct leaf", but it also shows
            the impact of that change on the function "void fn(C&)".

            In abidiff parlance, the change on "struct leaf" is called a
            leaf change.  So the --leaf-changes-only --impacted-interfaces
            options show, well, only the leaf change.  And it goes like
            this:

                $ abidiff -l libtest-v0.so libtest-v1.so
                'struct leaf' changed:
                  type size changed from 32 to 64 bits
                  1 data member insertion:
                    'char leaf::m1', at offset 32 (in bits) at test-v1.cc:4:1

                  one impacted interface:
                    function void fn(C&)
                $

            Note how the report ends by showing the list of interfaces
            impacted by the leaf change.

            Now if you don't want to see that list of impacted interfaces,
            then you can just avoid using the --impacted-interface option.
            You can learn about that option below, in any case.

          · --impacted-interfaces

            When showing leaf changes, this option instructs abidiff to show
            the list of impacted interfaces.  This option is thus to be used
            in addition the --leaf-changes-only option, otherwise, it's
            ignored.

          · --dump-diff-tree
              After the diff report, emit a textual representation of the
              diff nodes tree used by the comparison engine to represent the
              changed functions and variables.  That representation is
              emitted to the error output for debugging purposes.  Note that
              this diff tree is relevant only to functions and variables
              that have some sub-type changes.  Added or removed functions
              and variables do not have any diff nodes tree associated to
              them.

            Emit statistics about various internal things.

RETURN VALUES         top

       The exit code of the abidiff command is either 0 if the ABI of the
       binaries being compared are equal, or non-zero if they differ or if
       the tool encountered an error.

       In the later case, the exit code is a 8-bits-wide bit field in which
       each bit has a specific meaning.

       The first bit, of value 1, named ABIDIFF_ERROR means there was an
       error.

       The second bit, of value 2, named ABIDIFF_USAGE_ERROR means there was
       an error in the way the user invoked the tool.  It might be set, for
       instance, if the user invoked the tool with an unknown command line
       switch, with a wrong number or argument, etc.  If this bit is set,
       then the ABIDIFF_ERROR bit must be set as well.

       The third bit, of value 4, named ABIDIFF_ABI_CHANGE means the ABI of
       the binaries being compared are different.

       The fourth bit, of value 8, named ABIDIFF_ABI_INCOMPATIBLE_CHANGE
       means the ABI of the binaries compared are different in an
       incompatible way.  If this bit is set, then the ABIDIFF_ABI_CHANGE
       bit must be set as well.  If the ABIDIFF_ABI_CHANGE is set and the
       ABIDIFF_INCOMPATIBLE_CHANGE is NOT set, then it means that the ABIs
       being compared might or might not be compatible.  In that case, a
       human being needs to review the ABI changes to decide if they are
       compatible or not.

       Note that, at the moment, there are only a few kinds of ABI changes
       that would result in setting the flag
       ABIDIFF_ABI_INCOMPATIBLE_CHANGE.  Those ABI changes are either:

          · the removal of the symbol of a function or variable that has
            been defined and exported.

          · the modification of the index of a member of a virtual function
            table (for C++ programs and libraries).

       With time, when more ABI change patterns are found to always
       constitute incompatible ABI changes, we will adapt the code to
       recognize those cases and set the ABIDIFF_ABI_INCOMPATIBLE_CHANGE
       accordingly.  So, if you find such patterns, please let us know.

       The remaining bits are not used for the moment.

NAME         top

       abidw - serialize the ABI of an ELF file

       abidw reads a shared library in ELF format and emits an XML represen‐
       tation of its ABI to standard  output.   The  emitted  representation
       includes all the globally defined functions and variables, along with
       a complete representation of their types.  It also includes a  repre‐
       sentation of the globally defined ELF symbols of the file.  The input
       shared library must contain associated  debug  information  in  DWARF
       format.

       When  given  the  --linux-tree option, this program can also handle a
       Linux kernel tree.  That is, a directory tree that contains both  the
       vmlinux  binary  and  Linux  kernel modules.  It analyses those Linux
       kernel binaries and emits an  XML  representation  of  the  interface
       between the kernel and its module, to standard output.  In this case,
       we don't call it an ABI, but a KMI (Kernel  Module  Interface).   The
       emitted  KMI  includes  all  the globally defined functions and vari‐
       ables, along with a complete  representation  of  their  types.   The
       input  binaries  must  contain  associated debug information in DWARF
       format.

INVOCATION         top

          abidw [options] [<path-to-elf-file>]

OPTIONS         top

          · --help | -h

            Display a short help about the command and exit.

          · --version | -v

            Display the version of the program and exit.

          · --debug-info-dir | -d <dir-path>

            In cases where the debug info for path-to-elf-file is in a
            separate file that is located in a non-standard place, this
            tells abidw where to look for that debug info file.

            Note that dir-path must point to the root directory under which
            the debug information is arranged in a tree-like manner.  Under
            Red Hat based systems, that directory is usually
            <root>/usr/lib/debug.

            Note that this option is not mandatory for split debug
            information installed by your system's package manager because
            then abidw knows where to find it.

          · --out-file <file-path>

            This option instructs abidw to emit the XML representation of
            path-to-elf-file into the file file-path, rather than emitting
            it to its standard output.

          · --noout

            This option instructs abidw to not emit the XML representation
            of the ABI.  So it only reads the ELF and debug information,
            builds the internal representation of the ABI and exits.  This
            option is usually useful for debugging purposes.

          · --no-corpus-path

            Do not emit the path attribute for the ABI corpus.

          · --suppressions | suppr <path-to-suppression-specifications-file>

            Use a suppression specification file located at
            path-to-suppression-specifications-file.  Note that this option
            can appear multiple times on the command line.  In that case,
            all of the provided suppression specification files are taken
            into account.  ABI artifacts matched by the suppression
            specifications are suppressed from the output of this tool.

          · --kmi-whitelist | -kaw <path-to-whitelist>

            When analyzing a Linux kernel binary, this option points to the
            white list of names of ELF symbols of functions and variables
            which ABI must be written out.  That white list is called a "
            Kernel Module Interface white list".  This is because for the
            Kernel, we don't talk about the ABI; we rather talk about the
            interface between the Kernel and its module. Hence the term KMI
            rather than ABI

            Any other function or variable which ELF symbol are not present
            in that white list will not be considered by the KMI writing
            process.

            If this option is not provided -- thus if no white list is
            provided -- then the entire KMI, that is, all publicly defined
            and exported functions and global variables by the Linux Kernel
            binaries is emitted.

          · --linux-tree | --lt

            Make abidw to consider the input path as a path to a directory
            containing the vmlinux binary as several kernel modules
            binaries.  In that case, this program emits the representation
            of the Kernel Module Interface (KMI) on the standard output.

            Below is an example of usage of abidw on a Linux Kernel tree.

            First, checkout a Linux kernel source tree and build it.  Then
            install the kernel modules in a directory somewhere.  Copy the
            vmlinux binary into that directory too.  And then serialize the
            KMI of that kernel to disk, using abidw:

                $ git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git
                $ cd linux && git checkout v4.5
                $ make allyesconfig all
                $ mkdir build-output
                $ make INSTALL_MOD_PATH=./build-output modules_install
                $ cp vmlinux build-output/modules/4.5.0
                $ abidw --linux-tree build-output/modules/4.5.0 > build-output/linux-4.5.0.kmi

          · --headers-dir | --hd <headers-directory-path-1>

            Specifies where to find the public headers of the first shared
            library that the tool has to consider.  The tool will thus
            filter out types that are not defined in public headers.

          · --no-linux-kernel-mode

            Without this option, if abipkgiff detects that the binaries it
            is looking at are Linux Kernel binaries (either vmlinux or
            modules) then it only considers functions and variables which
            ELF symbols are listed in the __ksymtab and __ksymtab_gpl
            sections.

            With this option, abipkgdiff considers the binary as a
            non-special ELF binary.  It thus considers functions and
            variables which are defined and exported in the ELF sense.

          · --check-alternate-debug-info <elf-path>

            If the debug info for the file elf-path contains a reference to
            an alternate debug info file, abidw checks that it can find that
            alternate debug info file.  In that case, it emits a meaningful
            success message mentioning the full path to the alternate debug
            info file found.  Otherwise, it emits an error code.

          · --no-show-locs
              In the emitted ABI representation, do not show file, line or
              column where ABI artifacts are defined.

          · --check-alternate-debug-info-base-name <elf-path>

            Like --check-alternate-debug-info, but in the success message,
            only mention the base name of the debug info file; not its full
            path.

          · --load-all-types

            By default, libabigail (and thus abidw) only loads types that
            are reachable from functions and variables declarations that are
            publicly defined and exported by the binary.  So only those
            types are present in the output of abidw.  This option however
            makes abidw load all the types defined in the binaries, even
            those that are not reachable from public declarations.

          · --abidiff
              Load the ABI of the ELF binary given in argument, save it in
              libabigail's XML format in a temporary file; read the ABI from
              the temporary XML file and compare the ABI that has been read
              back against the ABI of the ELF binary given in argument.  The
              ABIs should compare equal.  If they don't, the program emits a
              diagnostic and exits with a non-zero code.

              This is a debugging and sanity check option.

          · --annotate
              Annotate the ABIXML output with comments above most elements.
              The comments are made of the pretty-printed form types,
              declaration or even ELF symbols.  The purpose is to make the
              ABIXML output more human-readable for debugging or documenting
              purposes.

          · --stats

            Emit statistics about various internal things.

          · --verbose

            Emit verbose logs about the progress of miscellaneous internal
            things.

NOTES         top

   Alternate debug info files
       As of the version 4 of the DWARF specification, Alternate debug
       information is a GNU extension to the DWARF specification.  It has
       however been proposed for inclusion into the upcoming version 5 of
       the DWARF standard.  You can read more about the GNU extensions to
       the DWARF standard here.

NAME         top

       abilint - validate an abigail ABI representation

       abilint  parses the native XML representation of an ABI as emitted by
       abidw.  Once it has parsed the XML representation of the ABI, abilint
       builds and in-memory model from it.  It then tries to save it back to
       an XML form, to standard output.  If that read-write  operation  suc‐
       ceeds chances are the input XML ABI representation is meaningful.

       Note  that  the  main intent of this tool to help debugging issues in
       the underlying Libabigail library.

       Note also that abilint can also read an ELF  input  file,  build  the
       in-memory  model  for its ABI, and serialize that model back into XML
       to standard output.  In that case, the ELF input file must be  accom‐
       panied with its debug information in the DWARF format.

INVOCATION         top

          abilint [options] [<abi-file1>]

OPTIONS         top

          · --help

            Display a short help message and exits.

          · --version | -v

            Display the version of the program and exit.

          · --debug-info-dir <path>

            When reading an ELF input file which debug information is split
            out into a separate file, this options tells abilint where to
            find that separate debug information file.

            Note that path must point to the root directory under which the
            debug information is arranged in a tree-like manner.  Under Red
            Hat based systems, that directory is usually
            <root>/usr/lib/debug.

            Note also that this option is not mandatory for split debug
            information installed by your system's package manager because
            then abidiff knows where to find it.

          · --diff

            For XML inputs, perform a text diff between the input and the
            memory model saved back to disk.  This can help to spot issues
            in the handling of the XML format by the underlying Libabigail
            library.

          · --noout

            Do not display anything on standard output.  The return code of
            the command is the only way to know if the command succeeded.

          · --suppressions | suppr <path-to-suppression-specifications-file>

            Use a suppression specification file located at
            path-to-suppression-specifications-file.  Note that this option
            can appear multiple times on the command line.  In that case,
            all of the provided suppression specification files are taken
            into account.  ABI artifacts matched by the suppression
            specifications are suppressed from the output of this tool.

            Specifies where to find the public headers of the first shared
            library that the tool has to consider.  The tool will thus
            filter out types that are not defined in public headers.

          · --stdin | --

            Read the input content from standard input.

          · --tu

            Expect the input XML to represent a single translation unit.

       abipkgdiff - compare ABIs of ELF files in software packages

       abipkgdiff  compares  the  Application Binary Interfaces (ABI) of the
       ELF binaries contained in two software packages.  The software  pack‐
       age  formats  currently  supported are Deb, RPM, tar archives (either
       compressed or not) and plain directories that contain binaries.

       For a comprehensive ABI change report  that  includes  changes  about
       function  and  variable  sub-types,  the  two  input packages must be
       accompanied with their debug information packages that contain  debug
       information in DWARF format.

INVOCATION         top

          abipkgdiff [option] <package1> <package2>

       package1 and package2 are the packages that contain the binaries to
       be compared.

ENVIRONMENT         top

       abipkgdiff loads two default suppression specifications files, merges
       their content and use it to filter out ABI change reports that might
       be considered as false positives to users.

       · Default system-wide suppression specification file

         It's located by the optional environment variable
         LIBABIGAIL_DEFAULT_SYSTEM_SUPPRESSION_FILE.  If that environment
         variable is not set, then abipkgdiff tries to load the suppression
         file $libdir/libabigail/libabigail-default.abignore.  If that file
         is not present, then no default system-wide suppression
         specification file is loaded.

       · Default user suppression specification file.

         It's located by the optional environment
         LIBABIGAIL_DEFAULT_USER_SUPPRESSION_FILE.  If that environment
         variable is not set, then abipkgdiff tries to load the suppression
         file $HOME/.abignore.  If that file is not present, then no default
         user suppression specification is loaded.

       In addition to those default suppression specification files,
       abipkgdiff will also look inside the packages being compared and if
       it sees a file that ends with the extension .abignore, then it will
       consider it as a suppression specification and it will combine it to
       the default suppression specification that might be already loaded.

       The user might as well use the --suppressions option (that is
       documented further below) to provide a suppression specification.

OPTIONS         top

          · --help | -h

            Display a short help about the command and exit.

          · --version | -v

            Display the version of the program and exit.

          · --debug-info-pkg1 | --d1 <path>

            For cases where the debug information for package1 is split out
            into a separate file, tells abipkgdiff where to find that
            separate debug information package.

            Note that the debug info for package1 can have been split into
            several different debug info packages.  In that case, several
            instances of this options can be provided, along with those
            several different debug info packages.

          · --debug-info-pkg2 | --d2 <path>

            For cases where the debug information for package2 is split out
            into a separate file, tells abipkgdiff where to find that
            separate debug information package.

            Note that the debug info for package2 can have been split into
            several different debug info packages.  In that case, several
            instances of this options can be provided, along with those
            several different debug info packages.

          · --devel-pkg1 | --devel1 <path>

            Specifies where to find the Development Package associated with
            the first package to be compared.  That Development Package at
            path should at least contain header files in which public types
            exposed by the libraries (of the first package to be compared)
            are defined.  When this option is provided, the tool filters out
            reports about ABI changes to types that are NOT defined in these
            header files.

          · --devel-pkg2 | --devel2 <path>

            Specifies where to find the Development Package associated with
            the second package to be compared.  That Development Package at
            path should at least contains header files in which public types
            exposed by the libraries (of the second package to be compared)
            are defined.  When this option is provided, the tool filters out
            reports about ABI changes to types that are NOT defined in these
            header files.

          · --drop-private-types

            This option is to be used with the --devel-pkg1 and --devel-pkg2
            options.  With this option, types that are NOT defined in the
            headers are entirely dropped from the internal representation
            build by Libabigail to represent the ABI.  They thus don't have
            to be filtered out from the final ABI change report because they
            are not even present in Libabigail's representation.

            Without this option however, those private types are kept in the
            internal representation and later filtered out from the report.

            This options thus potentially makes Libabigail consume less
            memory.  It's meant to be mainly used to optimize the memory
            consumption of the tool on binaries with a lot of publicly
            defined and exported types.

          · --dso-only

            Compare ELF files that are shared libraries, only.  Do not
            compare executable files, for instance.

          · --private-dso

            By default, abipkgdiff does not compare DSOs that are private to
            the RPM package.  A private DSO is a DSO which SONAME is NOT
            advertised in the "provides" property of the RPM.

            This option instructs abipkgdiff to also compare DSOs that are
            NOT advertised in the "provides" property of the RPM.

            Please note that the fact that (by default) abipkgdiff skips
            private DSO is a feature that is available only for RPMs, at the
            moment.  We would happily accept patches adding that feature for
            other package formats.

          · --leaf-changes-only|-l only show leaf changes, so don't show
            impact analysis report.

            The typical output of abipkgdiff and abidiff when comparing two
            binaries, that we shall call full impact report, looks like this

                $ abidiff libtest-v0.so libtest-v1.so
                Functions changes summary: 0 Removed, 1 Changed, 0 Added function
                Variables changes summary: 0 Removed, 0 Changed, 0 Added variable

                1 function with some indirect sub-type change:

                  [C]'function void fn(C&)' at test-v1.cc:13:1 has some indirect sub-type changes:
                    parameter 1 of type 'C&' has sub-type changes:
                      in referenced type 'struct C' at test-v1.cc:7:1:
                        type size hasn't changed
                        1 data member change:
                         type of 'leaf* C::m0' changed:
                           in pointed to type 'struct leaf' at test-v1.cc:1:1:
                             type size changed from 32 to 64 bits
                             1 data member insertion:
                               'char leaf::m1', at offset 32 (in bits) at test-v1.cc:4:1

                $

            So in that example the report emits information about how the
            data member insertion change of "struct leaf" is reachable from
            function "void fn(C&)".  In other words, the report not only
            shows the data member change on "struct leaf", but it also shows
            the impact of that change on the function "void fn(C&)".

            In abidiff (and abipkgdiff) parlance, the change on "struct
            leaf" is called a leaf change.  So the --leaf-changes-only
            --impacted-interfaces options show, well, only the leaf change.
            And it goes like this:

                $ abidiff -l libtest-v0.so libtest-v1.so
                'struct leaf' changed:
                  type size changed from 32 to 64 bits
                  1 data member insertion:
                    'char leaf::m1', at offset 32 (in bits) at test-v1.cc:4:1

                  one impacted interface:
                    function void fn(C&)
                $

            Note how the report ends up by showing the list of interfaces
            impacted by the leaf change.  That's the effect of the
            additional --impacted-interfaces option.

            Now if you don't want to see that list of impacted interfaces,
            then you can just avoid using the --impacted-interface option.
            You can learn about that option below, in any case.

            Please note that when comparing two Linux Kernel packages, it's
            this leaf changes report that is emitted, by default.  The
            normal so-called full impact report can be emitted with the
            option --full-impact which is documented later below.

          · --impacted-interfaces

            When showing leaf changes, this option instructs abipkgdiff to
            show the list of impacted interfaces.  This option is thus to be
            used in addition to the --leaf-changes-only option, or, when
            comparing two Linux Kernel packages.  Otherwise, it's simply
            ignored.

          · --full-impact|-f

            When comparing two Linux Kernel packages, this function
            instructs abipkgdiff to emit the so-called full impact report,
            which is the default report kind emitted by the abidiff tool:

                $ abidiff libtest-v0.so libtest-v1.so
                Functions changes summary: 0 Removed, 1 Changed, 0 Added function
                Variables changes summary: 0 Removed, 0 Changed, 0 Added variable

                1 function with some indirect sub-type change:

                  [C]'function void fn(C&)' at test-v1.cc:13:1 has some indirect sub-type changes:
                    parameter 1 of type 'C&' has sub-type changes:
                      in referenced type 'struct C' at test-v1.cc:7:1:
                        type size hasn't changed
                        1 data member change:
                         type of 'leaf* C::m0' changed:
                           in pointed to type 'struct leaf' at test-v1.cc:1:1:
                             type size changed from 32 to 64 bits
                             1 data member insertion:
                               'char leaf::m1', at offset 32 (in bits) at test-v1.cc:4:1

                $

          · --redundant
              In the diff reports, do display redundant changes.  A
              redundant change is a change that has been displayed elsewhere
              in a given report.

          · --harmless

            In the diff report, display only the harmless changes.  By
            default, the harmless changes are filtered out of the diff
            report keep the clutter to a minimum and have a greater chance
            to spot real ABI issues.

          · --no-linkage-name

            In the resulting report, do not display the linkage names of the
            added, removed, or changed functions or variables.

          · --no-added-syms

            Do not show the list of functions, variables, or any symbol that
            was added.

          · --no-added-binaries

            Do not show the list of binaries that got added to the second
            package.

            Please note that the presence of such added binaries is not
            considered like an ABI change by this tool; as such, it doesn't
            have any impact on the exit code of the tool.  It does only have
            an informational value.  Removed binaries are, however,
            considered as an ABI change.

          · --no-abignore

            Do not search the package for the presence of suppression files.

          · --no-parallel

            By default, abipkgdiff will use all the processors it has
            available to execute concurrently.  This option tells it not to
            extract packages or run comparisons in parallel.

          · --no-default-suppression

            Do not load the default suppression specification files.

          · --suppressions | --suppr <path-to-suppressions>

            Use a suppression specification file located at
            path-to-suppressions.  Note that this option can appear multiple
            times on the command line.  In that case, all of the suppression
            specification files are taken into account.

            Please note that, by default, if this option is not provided,
            then the default suppression specification files are loaded .

          · --linux-kernel-abi-whitelist | -w <path-to-whitelist>

            When comparing two Linux kernel RPM packages, this option points
            to the white list of names of ELF symbols of functions and
            variables that must be compared for ABI changes.  That white
            list is called a "Linux kernel ABI white list".

            Any other function or variable which ELF symbol are not present
            in that white list will not be considered by the ABI comparison
            process.

            If this option is not provided -- thus if no white list is
            provided -- then the ABI of all publicly defined and exported
            functions and global variables by the Linux Kernel binaries are
            compared.

            Please note that if a white list package is given in parameter,
            this option handles it just fine, like if the --wp option was
            used.

          · --wp <path-to-whitelist-package>

            When comparing two Linux kernel RPM packages, this option points
            an RPM package containining several white lists of names of ELF
            symbols of functions and variables that must be compared for ABI
            changes.  Those white lists are called "Linux kernel ABI white
            lists".

            From the content of that white list package, this program then
            chooses the appropriate Linux kernel ABI white list to consider
            when comparing the ABI of Linux kernel binaries contained in the
            Linux kernel packages provided on the command line.

            That choosen Linux kernel ABI white list contains the list of
            names of ELF symbols of functions and variables that must be
            compared for ABI changes.

            Any other function or variable which ELF symbol are not present
            in that white list will not be considered by the ABI comparison
            process.

            Note that this option can be provided twice (not mor than
            twice), specifying one white list package for each Linux Kernel
            package that is provided on the command line.

            If this option is not provided -- thus if no white list is
            provided -- then the ABI of all publicly defined and exported
            functions and global variables by the Linux Kernel binaries are
            compared.

          · --no-unreferenced-symbols

            In the resulting report, do not display change information about
            function and variable symbols that are not referenced by any
            debug information.  Note that for these symbols not referenced
            by any debug information, the change information displayed is
            either added or removed symbols.

          · --no-show-locs
              Do not show information about where in the second shared
              library the respective type was changed.

          · --no-show-relative-offset-changes

            Without this option, when the offset of a data member changes,
            the change report not only mentions the older and newer offset,
            but it also mentions by how many bits the data member changes.
            With this option, the latter is not shown.

          · --show-identical-binaries
              Show the names of the all binaries compared, including the
              binaries whose ABI compare equal.  By default, when this
              option is not provided, only binaries with ABI changes are
              mentionned in the output.

          · --fail-no-dbg

            Make the program fail and return a non-zero exit code if
            couldn't read any of the debug information that comes from the
            debug info packages that were given on the command line.  If no
            debug info package were provided on the command line then this
            option is not active.

            Note that the non-zero exit code returned by the program as a
            result of this option is the constant ABIDIFF_ERROR.  To know
            the numerical value of that constant, please refer to the exit
            code documentation.

          · --keep-tmp-files

            Do not erase the temporary directory files that are created
            during the execution of the tool.

          · --verbose

            Emit verbose progress messages.

RETURN VALUE         top

       The exit code of the abipkgdiff command is either 0 if the ABI of the
       binaries compared are equal, or non-zero if they differ or if the
       tool encountered an error.

       In the later case, the value of the exit code is the same as for the
       abidiff tool.

AC(1)                      General Commands Manual                     AC(1)

NAME         top

       ac -  print statistics about users' connect time

SYNOPSIS         top

       ac     [ -d | --daily-totals ] [ -y | --print-year ]
              [ -p | --individual-totals ] [ people ]
              [ -f | --file filename ] [ -a | --all-days ]
              [ --complain ] [ --reboots ] [ --supplants ]
              [ --timewarps ] [ --compatibility ]
              [ --tw-leniency num ] [ --tw-suspicious num ]
              [ -z | --print-zeros ] [ --debug ]
              [ -V | --version ] [ -h | --help ]

DESCRIPTION         top

       ac prints out a report of connect time (in hours) based on the
       logins/logouts in the current wtmp file.  A total is also printed
       out.

       The accounting file wtmp is maintained by init(8) and login(1).
       Neither ac nor login creates the wtmp if it doesn't exist, no
       accounting is done.  To begin accounting, create the file with a
       length of zero.

       NOTE:  The wtmp file can get really big, really fast.  You might want
       to trim it every once and a while.

       GNU ac works nearly the same UNIX ac, though it's a little smarter in
       several ways.  You should therefore expect differences in the output
       of GNU ac and the output of ac's on other systems.  Use the command
       info accounting to get additional information.

OPTIONS         top

       -d, --daily-totals
              Print totals for each day rather than just one big total at
              the end.  The output looks like this:
                      Jul  3  total     1.17
                      Jul  4  total     2.10
                      Jul  5  total     8.23
                      Jul  6  total     2.10
                      Jul  7  total     0.30
       -p, --individual-totals
              Print time totals for each user in addition to the usual
              everything-lumped-into-one value.  It looks like:
                      bob       8.06
                      goff      0.60
                      maley     7.37
                      root      0.12
                      total    16.15
       people Print out the sum total of the connect time used by all of the
              users included in people.  Note that people is a space
              separated list of valid user names; wildcards are not allowed.
       -f, --file filename
              Read from the file filename instead of the system's wtmp file.
       --complain
              When the wtmp file has a problem (a time-warp, missing record,
              or whatever), print out an appropriate error.
       --reboots
              Reboot records are NOT written at the time of a reboot, but
              when the system restarts; therefore, it is impossible to know
              exactly when the reboot occurred.  Users may have been logged
              into the system at the time of the reboot, and many ac's
              automatically count the time between the login and the reboot
              record against the user (even though all of that time
              shouldn't be, perhaps, if the system is down for a long time,
              for instance).  If you want to count this time, include the
              flag.  *For vanilla ac compatibility, include this flag.*
       --supplants
              Sometimes, a logout record is not written for a specific
              terminal, so the time that the last user accrued cannot be
              calculated.  If you want to include the time from the user's
              login to the next login on the terminal (though probably
              incorrect), include this you want to include the time from the
              user's login to the next login on the terminal (though
              probably incorrect), include this flag.  *For vanilla ac
              compatibility, include this flag.*
       --timewarps
              Sometimes, entries in a wtmp file will suddenly jump back into
              the past without a clock change record occurring.  It is
              impossible to know how long a user was logged in when this
              occurs.  If you want to count the time between the login and
              the time warp against the user, include this flag.  *For
              vanilla ac compatibility, include this flag.*
       --compatibility
              This is shorthand for typing out the three above options.
       -a, --all-days
              If we're printing daily totals, print a record for every day
              instead of skipping intervening days where there is no login
              activity.  Without this flag, time accrued during those
              intervening days gets listed under the next day where there is
              login activity.
       --tw-leniency num
              Set the time warp leniency to num seconds.  Records in wtmp
              files might be slightly out of order (most notably when two
              logins occur within a one-second period - the second one gets
              written first).  By default, this value is set to 60.  If the
              program notices this problem, time is not assigned to users
              unless the --timewarps flag is used.
       --tw-suspicious num
              Set the time warp suspicious value to num seconds.  If two
              records in the wtmp file are farther than this number of
              seconds apart, there is a problem with the wtmp file (or your
              machine hasn't been used in a year).  If the program notices
              this problem, time is not assigned to users unless the
              --timewarps flag is used.
       -y, --print-year
              Print year when displaying dates.
       -z, --print-zeros
              If a total for any category (save the grand total) is zero,
              print it.  The default is to suppress printing.
       --debug
              Print verbose internal information.
       -V, --version
              Print the version number of ac to standard output and quit.
       -h, --help
              Prints the usage string and default locations of system files
              to standard output and exits.

ADDFTINFO(1)               General Commands Manual              ADDFTINFO(1)

NAME         top

       addftinfo - add information to troff font files for use with groff

SYNOPSIS         top

       addftinfo [ -v ] [ param-option value... ] res unitwidth font

DESCRIPTION         top

       addftinfo reads a troff font file and adds some additional font-
       metric information that is used by the groff system.  The font file
       with the information added is written on the standard output.  The
       information added is guessed using some parametric information about
       the font and assumptions about the traditional troff names for
       characters.  The main information added is the heights and depths of
       characters.  The res and unitwidth arguments should be the same as
       the corresponding parameters in the DESC file; font is the name of
       the file describing the font; if font ends with I the font will be
       assumed to be italic.

OPTIONS         top

       -v prints the version number.

       All other options change one of the parameters that are used to
       derive the heights and depths.  Like the existing quantities in the
       font file, each value is in inches/res for a font whose point size is
       unitwidth.  param-option must be one of:

       -x-height
              The height of lowercase letters without ascenders such as x.

       -fig-height
              The height of figures (digits).

       -asc-height
              The height of characters with ascenders, such as b, d or l.

       -body-height
              The height of characters such as parentheses.

       -cap-height
              The height of uppercase letters such as A.

       -comma-depth
              The depth of a comma.

       -desc-depth
              The depth of characters with descenders, such as p, q, or y.

       -body-depth
              The depth of characters such as parentheses.

       addftinfo makes no attempt to use the specified parameters to guess
       the unspecified parameters.  If a parameter is not specified the
       default will be used.  The defaults are chosen to have the reasonable
       values for a Times font.

NAME         top

       addr2line - convert addresses into file names and line numbers.

SYNOPSIS         top

       addr2line [-a|--addresses]
                 [-b bfdname|--target=bfdname]
                 [-C|--demangle[=style]]
                 [-e filename|--exe=filename]
                 [-f|--functions] [-s|--basename]
                 [-i|--inlines]
                 [-p|--pretty-print]
                 [-j|--section=name]
                 [-H|--help] [-V|--version]
                 [addr addr ...]

DESCRIPTION         top

       addr2line translates addresses into file names and line numbers.
       Given an address in an executable or an offset in a section of a
       relocatable object, it uses the debugging information to figure out
       which file name and line number are associated with it.

       The executable or relocatable object to use is specified with the -e
       option.  The default is the file a.out.  The section in the
       relocatable object to use is specified with the -j option.

       addr2line has two modes of operation.

       In the first, hexadecimal addresses are specified on the command
       line, and addr2line displays the file name and line number for each
       address.

       In the second, addr2line reads hexadecimal addresses from standard
       input, and prints the file name and line number for each address on
       standard output.  In this mode, addr2line may be used in a pipe to
       convert dynamically chosen addresses.

       The format of the output is FILENAME:LINENO.  By default each input
       address generates one line of output.

       Two options can generate additional lines before each FILENAME:LINENO
       line (in that order).

       If the -a option is used then a line with the input address is
       displayed.

       If the -f option is used, then a line with the FUNCTIONNAME is
       displayed.  This is the name of the function containing the address.

       One option can generate additional lines after the FILENAME:LINENO
       line.

       If the -i option is used and the code at the given address is present
       there because of inlining by the compiler then additional lines are
       displayed afterwards.  One or two extra lines (if the -f option is
       used) are displayed for each inlined function.

       Alternatively if the -p option is used then each input address
       generates a single, long, output line containing the address, the
       function name, the file name and the line number.  If the -i option
       has also been used then any inlined functions will be displayed in
       the same manner, but on separate lines, and prefixed by the text
       (inlined by).

       If the file name or function name can not be determined, addr2line
       will print two question marks in their place.  If the line number can
       not be determined, addr2line will print 0.

OPTIONS         top

       The long and short forms of options, shown here as alternatives, are
       equivalent.

       -a
       --addresses
           Display the address before the function name, file and line
           number information.  The address is printed with a 0x prefix to
           easily identify it.

       -b bfdname
       --target=bfdname
           Specify that the object-code format for the object files is
           bfdname.

       -C
       --demangle[=style]
           Decode (demangle) low-level symbol names into user-level names.
           Besides removing any initial underscore prepended by the system,
           this makes C++ function names readable.  Different compilers have
           different mangling styles. The optional demangling style argument
           can be used to choose an appropriate demangling style for your
           compiler.

       -e filename
       --exe=filename
           Specify the name of the executable for which addresses should be
           translated.  The default file is a.out.

       -f
       --functions
           Display function names as well as file and line number
           information.

       -s
       --basenames
           Display only the base of each file name.

       -i
       --inlines
           If the address belongs to a function that was inlined, the source
           information for all enclosing scopes back to the first non-
           inlined function will also be printed.  For example, if "main"
           inlines "callee1" which inlines "callee2", and address is from
           "callee2", the source information for "callee1" and "main" will
           also be printed.

       -j
       --section
           Read offsets relative to the specified section instead of
           absolute addresses.

       -p
       --pretty-print
           Make the output more human friendly: each location are printed on
           one line.  If option -i is specified, lines for all enclosing
           scopes are prefixed with (inlined by).

       @file
           Read command-line options from file.  The options read are
           inserted in place of the original @file option.  If file does not
           exist, or cannot be read, then the option will be treated
           literally, and not removed.

           Options in file are separated by whitespace.  A whitespace
           character may be included in an option by surrounding the entire
           option in either single or double quotes.  Any character
           (including a backslash) may be included by prefixing the
           character to be included with a backslash.  The file may itself
           contain additional @file options; any such options will be
           processed recursively.
