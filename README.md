 This project started as an informal way to order and share notes and quick-sheets on software development and system administration.
 
 Suddenly I found myself leaving Google Search appart for daily tasks and browsing my notes more and more frequently.
 
 Being  VIM-user, used to move fast and work fast I started to find more and more uncorfotable as content grew and grew and scrolling or spliting into different pages became slow (acording to VIM standards).
 
  A new radical, and css-styling-psychopathically way of formatting and zooming surged to put all the info close to each related topic. (Your screen pixels are finite, don't waste them!!!). 
 
 Then it came the embedded micro-search engine, more and more content...
 
 To be continued...
