<span xsmall>Secret</span>
<span xsmall>Manager</span>
@[https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/]
AWS Secrets Manager helps you protect secrets needed to access your
applications, services, and IT resources. The service enables you to easily
rotate, manage, and retrieve database credentials, API keys, and other
secrets throughout their lifecycle. Users and applications retrieve secrets
with a call to Secrets Manager APIs, eliminating the need to hardcode
sensitive information in plain text. Secrets Manager offers secret rotation
with built-in integration for Amazon RDS, Amazon Redshift, and Amazon
DocumentDB. Also, the service is extensible to other types of secrets,
including API keys and OAuth tokens. In addition, Secrets Manager enables you
to control access to secrets using fine-grained permissions and audit secret
rotation centrally for resources in the AWS Cloud, third-party services, and
on-premises.
ºBenefits:º
- Rotate secrets safely
- Manage access with fine-grained policies
- Secure and audit secrets centrally
- Pay as you go

@[https://www.infoq.com/news/2018/04/aws-secret-manager-manage]
Amazon announced the launch of the AWS Secrets Manager, which makes it easy
for customers to store and retrieve secrets using an API or the AWS Command
Line Interface (CLI). Furthermore, customers can rotate their credentials
with the built-in schedule feature or custom Lambda functions. The AWS
Secrets Manager enables users to centralize the management of secrets of
distributed services and applications.

<span xsmall>Automate</span>
<span xsmall>Sec.Rule</span>
<span xsmall>Update</span>

- STEP 1: Verify that AWS user has the needed rights/permissions.
          for AmazonEC2FullAccess policy

- STEP 2: Test that you can see the security policies
          Example output
          $ aws ec2 describe-security-groups
          → {
          →   "SecurityGroups": [
          →     {
          →       "IpPermissionsEgress": [
          →         ...(egress rules)...
          →       ],
          →       "Description": "default VPC security group",
          →       "IpPermissions": [
          →         ...(ingress rules)...
          →       ],
          →
          →       "GroupName": "default",
          →       "VpcId": "vpc-a6e13ecf",
          →       "OwnerId": "923026411698",
          →       "GroupId": "sg-0433846d"
          →     },
          → ...(other security groups)...
          → }

- STEP 3:
  Test adding/removing new ingress rules:
  $ EXTERNAL_IP01=$(wget http://ipinfo.io/ip -qO -)
  $ CidrIp01="${EXTERNAL_IP01}/32"
  $ IP_PERMISSIONS="[{"
  $ IP_PERMISSIONS="${IP_PERMISSIONS} \"IpProtocol\": \"tcp\","
  $ IP_PERMISSIONS="${IP_PERMISSIONS} \"FromPort\"  : 22,"
  $ IP_PERMISSIONS="${IP_PERMISSIONS} \"ToPort\"    : 22, "
  $ IP_PERMISSIONS="${IP_PERMISSIONS} \"IpRanges\"  : [{\"CidrIp\": \"${CidrIp01}\"}]"
  $ IP_PERMISSIONS="${IP_PERMISSIONS} }]"
  $ SG_ID="sg-0123456d"

  $ aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress --group-id ${SG_ID} \
        --dry-run \                            ← Check changes. Do not update
        --ip-permissions '${IP_PERMISSIONS}'
    ^^^^^^^
    remove like:
  $ aws ec2    revoke-security-group-ingress --group-id ${SG_ID} \
        --ip-permissions '${IP_PERMISSIONS}'

<span xsmall>CloudTrail</span>
@[https://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/]
AWS CloudTrail is a service that enables governance, compliance, operational
auditing, and risk auditing of your AWS account. With CloudTrail, you can log
, continuously monitor, and retain account activity related to actions across
your AWS infrastructure. CloudTrail provides event history of your AWS
account activity, including actions taken through the AWS Management Console,
AWS SDKs, command line tools, and other AWS services. This event history
simplifies security analysis, resource change tracking, and troubleshooting.
</pre>


<pre zoom labels="security,monitoring" TODO>
<span xsmall>GuardDuty</span>

@[https://aws.amazon.com/guardduty/]
Amazon GuardDuty is a threat detection service that continuously monitors for
malicious activity and unauthorized behavior to protect your AWS accounts and
workloads. With the cloud, the collection and aggregation of account and
network activities is simplified, but it can be time consuming for security
teams to continuously analyze event log data for potential threats. With
GuardDuty, you now have an intelligent and cost-effective option for
continuous threat detection in the AWS Cloud. The service uses machine
learning, anomaly detection, and integrated threat intelligence to identify
and prioritize potential threats. GuardDuty analyzes tens of billions of
events across multiple AWS data sources, such as AWS CloudTrail, Amazon VPC
Flow Logs, and DNS logs. With a few clicks in the AWS Management Console,
GuardDuty can be enabled with no software or hardware to deploy or maintain.
By integrating with AWS CloudWatch Events, GuardDuty alerts are actionable,
easy to aggregate across multiple accounts, and straightforward to push into
existing event management and workflow systems.


@[https://www.infoq.com/news/2019/02/aws-guardduty-threat-detections]
Amazon has added another set of new threat detections to its GuardDuty service in AWS. The three new threat detections are two new penetration testing detections and one policy violation detection.

Amazon GuardDuty is a threat detection service available on AWS that continuously monitors for malicious or unauthorized behaviour to help customers protect their AWS accounts and workloads. When a threat is detected, the service will send a detailed security alert to the GuardDuty console and AWS CloudWatch Events – thus making alerts actionable and easy to integrate into existing event management and workflow systems.

AWS CloudFormation:
- common language to describe and provision all
  the infrastructure resources in a cloud environment,
  using a programming languages or a simple text file
  to model and provision, in an automated and secure manner,
  all the resources needed for your applications across all
  regions and accounts.
ºThis gives you a single source of truth for your AWS resources.º

- See also @[https://www.pulumi.com/]
           @[https://www.pulumi.com/docs/intro/vs/cloud_templates/]

@[https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/bfh7mj/how_to_be_more_productive_with_cloudformation/]
"""
  I’ve used a tool called Sceptre (https://github.com/cloudreach/sceptre) with
  a lot of success. I’ve found that using vanilla CloudFormation via the aws-
cli to be very frustrating in comparison.

    It defines some nice conventions to using Cloud Formation. For example,
stack configuration (e.g. parameters, region, etc.) are stored in YAML
files in a configuration directory, where CloudFormation templates are
stored in the templates/ directory. Cloud Formation stacks are named via
convention of the file name and path.

   The CLI is a lot easier to use. Rather than having to switch between
create-stack, delete-stack, and update-stack — you can simple run
sceptre launch <stack>. Sceptre will figure out if the stack needs to
be created or is in a UPDATE_ROLLBACK_FAILED state — and either
create the stack, update the stack, or delete it and re-create it.

   Additionally, it shows the output of the CloudFormation events pane right
in the CLI so you don’t have to navigate windows to see logs.

   3. You can extend Sceptre to add functionality. For example, we store some
secrets in SecretsManager and it was trivially easy to configure Sceptre
to pull a secret out of SecretsManager and pass the encrypted string as a
parameter to a CloudFormation
template.

   4. It allows you to use Jinja templates — which greatly simplifies
CloudFormation templates with a lot of repetition (e.g. VPC / Subnet stacks
across multiple AZs)

   I was personally drawn to it because I could use native CloudFormation. I
could use all of my other tooling and resources. It just added a very nice
convention over top of it. We’ve used it for the last 10 months or so and
it has been very, very nice!

- Per default, AWS is assigning a dynamic private and a dynamic public IP address.
 ºpublic IP address and DNS name will change every time you restart the instanceº
- Deleting an instance is done by "Terminating" it.
  (it will still be visible in the instance dashboard as "Terminated" for a "long time")


Ex: Install Ubuntu from EC2 image repository
  - Enter EC2 Console then "Launch Instance".
    - Choose "Ubuntu HVM version" (looks to have better performance)
    Rºonly t1.micro is available for "Free tier"º
  - Review setup and "Launch"

  - Adapt Security Settings
    - click on "Edit security groups"
      - From the drop down list of the Source, select "My IP",
        then press "Review and Launch".
    - review instance data again and "Launch"

  - Create and download ºSSH Key Pairº
    - call the key "AWS_SSH_key" and download the generated PEM file

  - Check Instance Status
    - After clicking on the Instance Link, we will see that
      the instance is running and the "Status Checks" are being performed.
    - Public IP and DNS name (FQDN) will be displayed too.
      (remember that they change every time the image is started,
       a so-called Elastic IP -free of charge- needs to be rented
       from AWS to avoid this)

ºSTOP the Instance on AWSº
- Select the instance, choose Actions→Instance State→Stop.

ºDESTROY the Instance on AWSº

<span xsmall>Vagrant</span>
@[https://vocon-it.com/2016/04/01/aws-automation-using-vagrant-a-hello-world-example/]

NOTE: .
   Vagrant potentially allows for more sophisticated provisioning tasks
   when compared to AWS CLI commands like Software Installation and upload
   and execution of arbitrary shell scripts.

NOTE: Vagrant creates a local dummy Vagrant box supporting the AWS provider,
  used only to spin up a remote AWS (AMI) image in the cloud.
  ºNo Vagrant box is uploaded during the processº

- PRE-SETUP:
  - (Optional) Set HTTP proxy, if needed
    - export http_proxy='http://myproxy.dns.name:8080'
    - export https_proxy='http://myproxy.dns.name:8080'
      ^^^^^^
      replace with set on Win*

  - Install the VagrantºAWS pluginº
    $ vagrant plugin install vagrant-aws

  -ºDownload dummy box:º
    $ vagrant box add dummy \
      https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant-aws/raw/master/dummy.box

  - "init vagrant enviroment"
    $ mkdir MyVagrantBox
    $ cd    MyVagrantBox
    $ vagrant init
              ^^^^
              Will create a template Vagrantfile

  - Add next lines to "Vagrantfile"
    # Vagrantfile
    Vagrant.configure(2) do |config|
     config.vm.provider :aws do |aws, override|
       aws.access_key_id = ENV['AWS_KEY']
       aws.secret_access_key = ENV['AWS_SECRET']
       aws.keypair_name = ENV['AWS_KEYNAME']
       aws.ami = "ami-87564feb"                         ← See ami list in EC2 web console
       aws.region = "us-west-1"                         ← adapt to your (signed in) region
       aws.instance_type = "t2.micro"

       override.vm.box = "dummy"                        ←  Problem:
                                                           - Most boxes do not support AWS.
                                                           Work around:
                                                           - load dummy box with AWS provider
                                                             and override the image that
                                                              spin up in the Cloud

       override.ssh.username = "ubuntu"
       override.ssh.private_key_path = ENV['AWS_KEYPATH']  ← EC2 console/Net.Sec/Key Pairs
     end


   - Add a IAM user and apply the appropriate permissions
    - if not already done, create new user on the AWS IAM Users page, .
    - Assign required access rights to user like:
      - go to @[https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?region=eu-central-1#policies]
                                                               ^^^^^^^^^^^^
                                                               adapt to your setup
      - Click the "Get Started" button, if the list of policies is not visible already:
        you should see the list of policies and a filter field.
      - In the Filter field, search for the term ºAmazonEC2FullAccessº (Policy)
      - Click on this policy, then choose the tab Attached Identities.
      - Click "Attach" button and attach the main user.


  - create the launch script like:
    cat launch_aws.sh
    #!/bin/sh
    export AWS_KEY='your-key'            ← Create them on the "users" tab
    export AWS_SECRET='your-secret'        of the IAM console:
    export AWS_KEYNAME='your-keyname'      - click on "create new users"
    export AWS_KEYPATH='your-keypath'        You will be displayed the needed key/secret
    vagrant up --provider=aws

  - ./launch_aws.sh
    Bringing machine 'default' up with 'aws' provider...
    ==> default: Warning! The AWS provider doesn't support any of the Vagrant
    ==> default: high-level network configurations (`config.vm.network`). They
    ==> default: will be silently ignored.
    ==> ...
    ==> default: Waiting for SSH to become available...
    ... Rº(can take up to 20 minutes in free-tier)º
    ==> default: Machine is booted and ready for use!

  - Update the security group manually to allow SSH access to the instance.
    (Appendix B shows how to  automate with a shell script)
    Go to EC2 console/ºNetwork&Securityº/Sec.Groups,
    - we can find the default security group.
    - Edit the inbound rule to allow the current source IP address.

@[https://firecracker-microvm.github.io]
Firecracker implements a virtual machine monitor (VMM) that uses the Linux
Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) to create and manage microVMs. Firecracker has
a minimalist design. It excludes unnecessary devices and guest functionality to
reduce the memory footprint and attack surface area of each microVM.
This improves security, decreases the startup time, and increases hardware utilization.
Firecracker currently supports Intel CPUs, with planned AMD and Arm support.
Firecracker will also be integrated with popular container runtimes such as containerd.

<span title>Network:VPC</span>
Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) lets you provision a logically
isolated section of the AWS Cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a
virtual network that you define. You have complete control over your virtual
networking environment, including selection of your own IP address range,
creation of subnets, and configuration of route tables and network gateways.
You can use both IPv4 and IPv6 in your VPC for secure and easy access to
resources and applications.

Elastic Load Balancing automatically distributes incoming application traffic 
across multiple targets, such as Amazon EC2 instances, containers, IP 
addresses, and Lambda functions. It can handle the varying load of your 
application traffic in a single Availability Zone or across multiple 
Availability Zones. Elastic Load Balancing offers three types of load balancers 
that all feature the high availability, automatic scaling, and robust security 
necessary to make your applications fault tolerant.

AWS Direct Connect is a cloud service solution that makes it easy to establish
a dedicated network connection from your premises to AWS. Using AWS Direct
Connect, you can establish private connectivity between AWS and your
datacenter, office, or colocation environment, which in many cases can reduce
your network costs, increase bandwidth throughput, and provide a more
consistent network experience than Internet-based connections.

Amazon Releases AWS Outposts, Enabling Hybrid Data Center Architectures



In a recent blog post, Amazon announced the release of AWS Outposts, which allows AWS customers to take advantage of a single-vendor compute and storage solution. The Outposts architecture is based upon Amazon public cloud compute architecture but is hosted in a customer data center. This solution allows customers to take advantage of AWS technology, but addresses local processing and low latency requirements. Customers place infrastructure orders online, Amazon will then ship the modular compute rack and a trained AWS technician will connect, set up and validate the installation.
