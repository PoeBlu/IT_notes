<span xsmall>Concepts</span>
- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information-theoretic_security">Perfect Secrecy</a>
  refers to a cryptosystem whose security derives purely from information theory.
  In other words, it cannot be broken even if the adversary had unlimited computing power.
   The adversary simply does not have enough information to break the encryption and so the
  cryptosystems are considered cryptanalytically-unbreakable. 
   
- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_secrecy">(Perfect) Forward Secrecy</a>
     gives assurances your session keys will not be compromised even if the private key
     of the server is compromised. Forward secrecy protects past sessions against future
     compromises of secret keys or passwords.
     WARN: Simple simetric encryption schemas are NOT forward secrecy compliant, and a 
     compromised keys can reveal past encrypted-communications.
  
- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_sharing">Secret_sharing</a> 
    refers to methods for distributing a secret amongst a group of participants,
    each of whom is allocated a share of the secret. The secret can be reconstructed
    only when a sufficient number, of possibly different types, of shares are combined
    together; individual shares are of no use on their own.
  
- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avalanche_effect">Avalanche_effect</a>:
  desirable property of cryptographic algorithms, typically block ciphers and cryptographic
  hash functions, wherein if an input is changed slightly (for example, flipping a single bit),
  the output changes significantly. 
  
- *Doing encryption right is tough, managing secrets is even harder.*

<span xsmall>Symmetric primitives</span>
Peer 1                              Peer 2
Plain → |Encrypt|→ C1 → |Decrypt| → Plain
            ^                ^
            └─ KEY("Secret") ┘
            Shared by peer 1 and 2 

Symmetric cyrptography broadly splits into:
*Stream cipher*:
 - inputs of "any lenght". Very difficult to implement properly
   Implementations: ChaCha, ...
 
     INPUT     → |Keystream |→ K0, K1, ...
   (KEY, NONCE)  |Generator |         → XOR → C0, C1, ...
                               M0, M1, ... 
 
 - "BUTS": Generate a safe (non predictive) KEY for the stream cipher is "difficult"
*Block cipher*:
 - inputs must be divided into chunks of same size
 - Hide plaintext transformation to ciphertext through:
   - *confusion*: mapping input to output hard to predict (not linear and parts of keys)
   - *diffusion*: permutate bits
*SP-Networks*:
 - Most block ciphers are based on SP-Networks composed of:
   - Subtitution box : "map<byte, byte>"   (replace bytes with bytes )
   - Permutation box :  moves bits around
   - Some substitution plus permutation are combined into a single round
   - Rounds are then repeated enough times to ensure the algorithm is secure
   - SP-Networks alone are not enought. KEY secret is used like:
                  ROUND1                ROUND2
   Plain → XOR → |Subsitution| → XOR → |Subsitution| → C
           KEY   |Permutation|   KEY   |Permutation|

   -*AES*: SP-Network based (Advanced Encryption Standard).
     - "Almost every block cipher uses AES". Supersedes DES (2002 Standard)
     - Built around Rijndael (SP-Network with 128bit block size) and key length of 128,192, 256 bit
     - Round count depends on key lenght: 10, 12 or 14 cycles</li>
     - Each Round: SubBytes, ShiftRows, MixColumns</li>
     - Modern CPUs have hardware instruccions to accelerate AES computation
     - AES-NI x86 acceleration:
     - REF: study of AES-NI acceleration using (Libre|Open)SSL
       @[https://calomel.org/aesni_ssl_performance.html] November 08, 2018
     - AES-NI x86-extension provides: 
       - improved the speed of cryptographic calcs. using AES standard (AES-128,AES-256,...).
       - Must be enabled through the BIOS.
       - Only supported by real CPU cores, NOT hyper-threaded/Virtual cores
       - Designed to provide 4x to 8x speed improvements.
       - Checking AES-NI enabled on linux:
         $ cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep flags
         flags           : fpu vme ...*aes* ... arat

     - Test benchmark:
       - TLS v1.2 and TLS v1.3 connections (typical connections in HTTP/2 , HTTPS clients)
       - Testing soft:
         LibreSSL 2.5.0 ( ~ OpenSSL 1.0.2d) ; FreeBSD 11 ; Clang LLVM compiler
         8192 byte blocks
          Script used for testing:
          $ openssl speed -elapsed -evp chacha
          $ openssl speed -elapsed -evp aes-128-gcm
          $ openssl speed -elapsed -evp aes-256-gcm
          $ openssl speed -elapsed -evp aes-128-cbc
          $ openssl speed -elapsed -evp aes-256-cbc

     *Results:*
     AES Performance per-CPU-core for TLS v1.2 Ciphers

     *How do I interpret the results ?*
     Let's suppose:
       - connection bandwidth: 10 Gbs (=1,250MBs)
       - Web server is able to concurrently encrypt|decrypt
         data to saturate the 10 gigabit connection.
       - Suppose 100% of our clients use AES-128-GCM cipher
     
     IDEALLY we would like the CPU could processes 10Gbs/1,250MBs of AES encrypted data per-cpu-core. 
     - Since we need to recieve (decrypt) and send (encrypt) the data we need at least two(2) CPU cores.
       -  each CPU must be able to sustain 1,250 MB/s.
     - From previous performance-table, just "AMD Opteron 6380" and  faster ones will be able to keep to pace.
       (Note: Opteron-6380 has 16 cores, so it leaves many other CPU cores for network I/O, firewall rules, ...)
     
     REAL-WORLD:
       - Clients connect with a variety of ciphers and the system is not dedicated to 
         just cipher processing.
       - It is also possible that the cipher processing of multiple cpu cores can be
         added together to reach the desired speed. 
         - "Intel Xeon L5630" four cores that can process up to 701 MB/s AES-128-GCM data.(2,804 MBs)
         (enough speed for encrypting and decrypting data on a 10 gigabit link using AES-128-GCM)

<span xsmall>Modes of operation</span>
- A block cipher by itself is only suitable for the secure cryptographic 
  transformation (encryption or decryption) of one fixed-length group of bits
  called a block. A mode of operation describes how to repeatedly apply a 
  cipher's single-block operation to securely transform amounts of data larger
  than a block.
- Most modes require a unique binary sequence, often called 
  an initialization vector (IV), for each encryption operation. The IV has to
  be non-repeating and, for some modes, random as well. The initialization 
  vector is used to ensure distinct ciphertexts are produced even when the 
  same plaintext is encrypted multiple times independently with the same key.
- Block ciphers have one or more block size(s), but during transformation
  the block size is always fixed.
- Block cipher modes operate on whole blocks and require that the last part
  of the data be padded to a full block if it is smaller than the current 
  block size.
- There are, however, modes that do not require padding because they 
  effectively use a block cipher as a stream cipher.
- Electronic code block (ECB):
  (WARN: Don't use it, if different messages share same data information leaks cans rise)
M1 → |E_k| → C1
M2 → |E_k| → C2
M3 → |E_k| → C3
- Cipher block chaining (CBC):
IV: Initialization vector
M1 → |XOR(IV)| → |E_k| → C1
   → |XOR(M2)| → |E_k| → C2 
   → |XOR(M3)| → C3
  "BUTs": 
   - Not paralelizable , and can not seek randomnly
   - Needs an IV (Difficult to generate)
- Counter Mode (CT):(Can be paralellized)
  Nonce + 0 → |E_k| → XOR(M1) → C1
  Nonce + 1 → |E_k| → XOR(M2) → C2

  - *Signing* "==" message →Hash → PrivKey_encrypt → signature
    Everyone can decrypt using pub.key., probiding:

  - *Encrypt*  "==" (one-directional) encrypt using public key
      One-directional: Only private key owner can de-encrypt. Priv.key owner can not encrypt, only sign

    - DH-KEX (Key exchange) Underpins almost every aspect of our modern lives!
    - DH security is based first on "very big numbers", with 4096 bits becoming more ussual.
    - The DH-KEX generated shared-secret is usually called the "pre-master secret"
    - It's used to derive session keys through hashing for example
    - Ephemeral Mode. DH is used only for minutes/hours and not stored.
    
  - *RSA standard*: 
    - provides encryption and/or authentication
    - RSA provides us with Public (e,n) and Private (d)
        - e is usally a small number, 
        - d is a much large number
        - n is avery large semi-prime number n=p.q 
    
    - Can be used for encription (using pub key) and signing (using the private key)
    - It's compatible with integer prime number factorization, not with elliptic curves
    - It's computationally more expensive than DSA or ECDSA 
      but since it does not require a source of randomness is
      ussually prefered to alternatives in context like 
      embedded systems/smartcards/....

  fewer collisions (@[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collision_%28computer_science%29] and
  better avalanching(@[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avalanche_effect]).

- HMAC = "MAC + symetric encryption"</li>
- Message passes throuh a hash function twice, and is combined with
  the (secret key) key before each pass

message 
    → sym.cypher(key inner)
        → hash 
            → sym.cypher(key outer) 
                → hash
                    → out 
  
  An HMAC authenticates a message (principal == "owner of private key").
    If a message comes with a correct MAC attached, it means this message
    was seen by a holder of the secret key at some point.
    HMAC is a signature based on a secret key, providing similar 
    assurances to a signature scheme based on public-key cryptography

  <a TODO href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography)">Salt</a>
    is random data that is used as an additional input to a one-way function 
    that "hashes" data, a password or passphrase. Salts are closely related to 
    the concept of nonce. The primary function of salts is to <b>defend against
    dictionary attacks</b> or against its hashed equivalent, a pre-computed rainbow table attack.
    <b>Nonce must not be repeated, but can be predictable. Salts must not be repeated, and
    also they must be cryptographically random to be secure.</b>
  
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_nonce">Nonce</a> is
    an arbitrary number that can only be used once. It is similar in spirit to a nonce word,
    hence the name. It is often a random or pseudo-random number <b>issued in an authentication 
    protocol to ensure that old communications cannot be reused in replay attacks</b>. 
    They can also be useful as initialization vectors and in cryptographic hash functions.

<span xsmall>Secret sharing</span>
@[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%27s_Secret_Sharing]
- provides a method of secret sharing, where a secret is divided into parts,
  giving each participant its own unique part, where some of the parts or all
  of them are needed in order to reconstruct the secret.
   Counting on all participants to combine the secret might be impractical, and
   therefore sometimes the threshold scheme is used where any "k" of the parts 
   are sufficient to reconstruct the original secret
  The essential idea of Adi Shamir's threshold scheme is that 2 points are 
   sufficient to define a line, 3 points are sufficient to define a parabola, 4
   points to define a cubic curve and so forth. That is, it takes k points to 
   define a polynomial of degree k − 1

<span xsmall>Authenticated Encryption (AE)</span>
<span xsmall>AE with associated data(AEAD)</span>

<a xsmall href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authenticated_encryption"></a>
- The need for AE emerged from the observation that securely combining 
   separate confidentiality and authentication block cipher operation modes 
   could be error prone and difficult confirmed by a number of practical
   attacks introduced into production protocols and applications by 
   incorrect implementation, or lack, of authentication (including SSL/TLS)
- A typical programming interface for AE mode implementation would provide the following functions:

 Encryption
     Input : plaintext, key, and optionally a header in plaintext that will not 
             be encrypted, but will be covered by authenticity protection.
     Output: ciphertext and authentication tag (message authentication code).
 Decryption
     Input : ciphertext, key, authentication tag, and optionally a header.
     Output: plaintext, or an error if the authentication tag does not match 
             the supplied ciphertext or header.

- Approaches to authenticated encryption:
  - Encrypt-then-MAC (EtM)
  - Encrypt-and-MAC (E-and-M)
  - MAC-then-Encrypt (MtE)

- G.C.T. project fixes several structural flaws in the SSL certificate system</li>
- open framework for monitoring and auditing SSL certificates in nearly real time.
  detecting SSL certificates that have been mistakenly issued by a certificate authority 
  or maliciously acquired from an otherwise unimpeachable certificate authority.
  It also makes it possible to identify certificate authorities that have gone rogue
  and are maliciously issuing certificates. 
- <def>Certificate LOGS</def>:simple network services that maintain cryptographically 
assured, publicly auditable, append-only records of certificates. Anyone can 
submit certificates to a log, although certificate authorities will likely be 
the foremost submitters  
- <def>Monitors</def> are publicly run servers that periodically contact all of the log 
servers and watch for suspicious certificates. For example, monitors can tell 
if an illegitimate or unauthorized certificate has been issued for a domain, 
and they can watch for certificates that have unusual certificate extensions 
or strange permissions, such as certificates that have CA capabilities.
  
- <def>Auditors</def>: lightweight components performing two functions:
- verify that logs are behaving correctly and are cryptographically
consistent. If a log is not behaving properly, then the log will need to explain
itself or risk being shut down.
- verify that a particular certificate appears in a log. This is a particularly
important auditing function because the Certificate Transparency framework 
requires that all SSL certificates be registered in a log. If a certificate has 
not been registered in a log, it’s a sign that the certificate is suspect, and
TLS clients may refuse to connect to sites that have suspect certificates.

 [protocol] Off-The-Record Messaging (OTR)</a>
- protocol for securing/authentication/encrypting instant messaging communication amongst people.
 Encrypts messages, prevents eavesdroppers, authenticates peers to each other.
 It also provides OTR provides forward secrecy and malleable encryption.

- OTR uses a combination of AES 128bits sym-key algorithm,  1536-bits group-size Diffie–Hellman 
  and the SHA-1 hash function.
- The primary motivation behind the protocol was providing deniable 
  authentication for the conversation participants while keeping 
  conversations confidential, like a private conversation in real life, or 
  off the record in journalism sourcing. This is in contrast with 
  cryptography tools that produce output which can be later used as a 
  verifiable record of the communication event and the identities of the 
  participants. The initial introductory paper was named "Off-the-Record 
  Communication, or, Why Not To Use PGP".[1]
- The OTR protocol was designed by cryptographers Ian Goldberg and Nikita 
  Borisov and released on 26 October 2004.[2] They provide a client library 
  to facilitate support for instant messaging client developers who want to 
  implement the protocol. A Pidgin and Kopete plugin exists that allows OTR 
  to be used over any IM protocol supported by Pidgin or Kopete, offering an 
  auto-detection feature that starts the OTR session with the buddies that 
  have it enabled, without interfering with regular, unencrypted

Dex acts as a portal to other identity providers through
"connectors." This lets dex defer authentication to 
LDAP servers, SAML providers, or established identity 
providers like GitHub, Google, and Active Directory.

 Clients write their authentication logic once to talk

- Crypto.libr for *non cryptographic experts
  cross-platform cryptographic library developed by a group of 
cryptographers and security engineers at Google to help developers implement 
cryptography correctly <b>without being cryptographic experts</b>.
version 1.2 adds support for Cloud, Android, and iOS platforms, and C++ and Objective-C.

aimed to stress cryptographic libraries against known attacks:
  - biased nonces
  - invalid curves
  - ...

ensure popular cryptographic algorithms behave as expected, including DSA, RSA, AES-EAX, ...

- Tink strives to make as explicit as possible what security guarantees each provided API gives:
  - For example, if a given operation is safe against chosen-ciphertext attacks, 
    this is displayed in the interface and that same guarantee has to be satisfied
    by each primitive used to implement it.

- currently four cryptographic operations are provided, implemented by specific primitives:

  - authenticated encryption with associated data (primitive: AEAD)
  - message authentication codes (primitive: MAC),
  - digital signatures (primitives: PublicKeySign and PublicKeyVerify)
  - hybrid encryption (primitives: HybridEncrypt and HybridDecrypt).

  Each operation has an associated set of minimal properties and a guarantee. 
  A primitive can have multiple implementations and the user chooses the actual
  implementation to use by instantiating a key of a corresponding type.

- Tink provides support for key management, 
  including key versioning/rotation/remote key management systems(KMS):

  -  Currently, the following KMSes are supported:
    Google Cloud KMS, Amazon KMS, Android Keystore, Apple iOS KeyChain (planned)

<span xsmall>Wallet vs Vault</span>
In Vaults, secrets are kept safe until needed by an application.

In wallets, the secrets (ideally) are never exposed outside the wallet.
Unsigned transactions come in, then signed transactions come out.
The wallet usually have aditional utility functions like "address agenda",
"browser of transactions", ...

A wallet makes use of a vault. (A vault is a "layer down the stack")

Vaults are generic for any type of app.

Wallets are mostly used for blockchain-like applications.

<span xsmall>Wallet vs Smart-Cards</span>
  - Some types of Smart-Cards can be considered a type of wallet, in 
  the sense that they can be used to sign content using a hardware
  protected private-key. 
  - Still Smart-Cards are mostly designed with Authentication as
    primary use-case, to provide that the user accessing a website,
    a bank terminal, ... is the real authorized user.
  - Wallets is mostly a blockchain concept, while smart-card is
    a general device that can be used for many purposes 
    (Web TLS or SSH Client Authentication, PGP signature, ...)
  - Wallets are designed with TX signature in mind.
    A wallet protects the private key, signs the TXs and probably
    has a display that shows what's going to be signed and a 
    physical button that the user must "click" in order to confirm
    the transaction.
  - Stealing of the wallet can mean stealing of the money.
  - Stealing of the smart-card means money can be stealed until
    the smart-card is cancelled.

<span xsmall><a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Deterministic_wallet">Deterministic Wallet</a></span>
A deterministic wallet is a system of deriving keys from 
a single starting point known as a seed. The seed allows 
a user to easily back up and restore a wallet without 
needing any other information and can in some cases allow 
the creation of public addresses without the knowledge of 
the private key. Seeds are typically serialized into 
human -readable words in a Mnemonic phrase.

- No server side storage, <b>private keys are generated from 
  the passphrase and only exist in the memory of the browser</b>
- Deterministic key generation: Write down the passphrase 
  generated for you and it's all you need
- Transactions are signed locally in the browser: Your 
  private keys are not shared with the server. You do not 
  have to trust the server with your money
- Privacy: No need to register a passphrase is all that 
  is required
- Public code hosted on Github which anyone can audit

<a xsmall href="https://blog.gridplus.io/lattice1-sdk-and-generalized-signatures-e17da7cf65d7">Lattice 1</a>
Lattice 1:

generalized "remote ("WiFi",...) signer" for 
cryptocurrencies, digital identity, and more.
(The priv.key is never transmited outside the hardware,
 unsigned docs come in and signed docs come out)

Remote Signing
wallet application technical components:
* <b>USER INTERFACE</b>: It interfaces with both 
  - persisted user data: addresses, TX history,...
  - network nodes: allow to display account info
* <b>TX BUILDER</b>: Applies the network protocol 
  to convert parameters (amount, recipient address
  , ...) into one or more hashes that make up a TX.
   Note: in Ethereum, each TX is represented by a 
     single hash, whereas in Bitcoin each consumed
     input has its own hash to sign,  there can be
     one or many inputs per Bitcoin transaction.
* <b>TX SIGNER: sign TX hashes with private key.


SEPARATING THE SIGNER:
STEP 1:
- let's consider moving TX signer to cloud machine.
  => you have to store your private key on the cloud
STEP 2:
-Move TX builder in the cloud too

"""In Lattice1 we have separated the protocol and
cryptographic functionality away from the application
layer ... Of course keys are in a secure chip within
the Lattice1."""

SECURING COMPONENTS AND SEPARATING CONCERNS:
- The Lattice1 introduces a more usable, robust, and
  secure connection between application ("wallet GUI")
  and TX builder/signer components.

 ┌────→ "GUI Apps in Cloud"
 │    
 ↓
Standard Chip ←---------→ Secure Chip 1 ←----→ Secure Chip 2
    ↑                        ↑                    ↑
-connect to            - Build TX hashes      - Store priv.keys
 outside apps          - Placed on device     - Make signatures
- request signatures                          - Placed on device 
- Lattice1 addition:                            and each Safe Card
  - facilitates (wireless) communication app←→Sec.Chip


GUI App Connection:
STEP 1: App    generates EC25519 key pair (just once)
STEP 2: Chip 1 generates EC25519 key pair (for each new app pairing)
STEP 3: PAIRING: ECDH Key exchange is use to interchange 
               App.pub_key ←→ Chip1.pub_key_for_app1      

In practice:
""app wants to pair with a user’s Lattice1 device.""

STEP 1: Find device by serial number
- find the user's agent based on a serial number.
  (not needed if Lattice1 can connect with the app
   on a local area network). 

STEP 2: Transfer a Secret Code (Out of Band)
Once the app can talk (insecurely) to the Lattice1,
- app generates secret code, signs hash with that code
  using a secp256k1 private key (is different to the EC25519
  used for encryption/decription) 
- User presses "Pair" button: 
- Appt sends a message to Lattice1 device <b>requesting pairing</b> start
- Lattice1 displays a place for the user to enter
  the same code that is displayed on the application.

- With correct code lattice1 can recover secp256k1 public key
  used to sign the hash and stores both that and the curve25519 
  public key, which is also sent in the payload.

STEP 3: Establish a Read-Only Permission
(Pairing is done at this point)
- Lattice1 gives app permission to view addresses, 
  request signatures (that must be authorized on device screen)
  for one-off (vs automated) signatures,...

FINAL STATE OF A PAIRING

APP:                     LATTICE1 Dev:
32-byte priv.key 

Pairing registry:
- app1.pub_secp256k1 (used to  check future request signatures)
- app1.pub_EC25519   (sed to decrypt future request payloads  )

(App has now established a secure connection)

some complex details avoided (using 1-time keys for future requests,
  separate pairing code generated by the Lattice1). 

REMOTE SIGNING
Now app can be used as a generalized TX Signer,
just like any other hardware wallet. Unlike other
hardware wallets, however, the paired application 
is capable of communicating with the device 
wirelessly.

We are now able to request a signature on some
piece of data, which is of course parameterized
and built in the CHip 1 (TX  Builder)

Manual Remote Signing
As mentioned above, the pairing process also creates a 
minimal "permission". The application may request a 
signature using this permission in a way similar to 
existing hardware wallet TXs:

- the Lattice1 device displays transactional data to the user
  and must wait for the user to hit “accept” on the touch 
  screen.

However, there are a few technical differences that are worth noting:

- data must conform to a pre-defined "schema".
 (periodically released as use cases emerge, like
  ETH transfers and BTC transactions (P2SH|P2PKH)

AUTOMATIC REMOTE SIGNING: (Ex. ecurring payments, keep-alive messages)
- Use of "recurring permissions", which require a pre-defined schema
 (just like manual signatures) in addition to a set of "rules" on the
 data that will be signed in the future. Such a permission might look like this:

{
  schemaIndex: 0,     ← published "schema" for Eth TX (0)
  typeIndex: 0,       ← ETh TX type.  0: standard TX (empty data)
  rules: [
    null    , null                                        , null,
    null    , null                                        , null,
    null    , null                                        , null,
    'equals', '0x39765400baa16dbcd1d7b473bac4d55dd5a7cffb', null,  ←  recipient
    'equals', 1000                                        , null,  ←  wei ammount
    'equals', ''                                          , null,
       ^                        ^                            ^
    typeOfRule             value1                           value2
  ],
  timeLimit: 10000                                                ← seconds elapsed between requests
}

specific rules [ nonce, gas, gasPrice, to, value, data ]

. In this case, the requester can only send a request once every 10,000 seconds. One second (or more) too early and the request will be denied.
Application SDK

All of the previously discussed functionality is made possible through a Grid+ Software Development Kit (SDK); this SDK will be released as an open source node.js module. We hope that developers wanting to build applications with a separated, internet-connected, secure signing service will experiment with the SDK and integrate with the Lattice1 device. Although Grid+ is building a mobile wallet application, this too will be open sourced as an example of how to leverage the Grid+ SDK.

Although the API is not finalized yet, the below Javascript snippet is an example of what using the SDK may look like:

const Sdk = require('gridplus-sdk');
const sdk = new Sdk({ btcNode: 'localhost:48332', ethNode: 'localhost:8545' });


const req = {
  type: 'eth-transfer',
  rules: {
    value: { 'equals': 1000 },
    to: { 'equals': '0x39765400baa16dbcd1d7b473bac4d55dd5a7cffb' }
  },
  interval: 10000
}

sdk.createAutomaticPermission(req, (err, res) => {
  ... do stuff ...
})

Keeping it General

Although this article mostly discusses the Lattice1 remote signing functionality in the context of cryptocurrency transfers, it is important to highlight that using an abstracted “signer” allows applications to request signatures on any data that is parametrizable. One can imagine, for example, a data schema that represents parameters of a legal contract:

TREZOR is basically a small computer. It is designed to 
protect your private keys from possible online and 
offline risks. In order to do this, TREZOR keeps the 
private keys away from the Internet and confirms the

<span xsmall>Trusted Execution Environement (TEE)</span>
<a xsmall href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_Guard_Extensions">Intel SGX</a>
CPU instruction set allowing user-level code to allocate 
private regions of memory (enclaves) protected from 
processes running at higher privilege levels. (secure 
remote computation, secure web browsing, DRM).

SGX is a set of instruction set extensions for CPUs 
released in Fall 2015 and available on recent CPUs. The 
key ability SGX provides is the notion of confidential, 
private execution with integrity guarantees. In essence, 
the chip has a special construct called an enclave. An 
enclave is like an ordinary program, except that the 
memory contents of an enclave are encrypted whenever they 
are off-chip, and accessible only on-chip, and only while 
the special enclave code is running. Further, the 
decryption keys are available solely to code with a 
certain hash: if you or a hacker were to hack the enclave 
code and change its hash, that hacked code will no longer 
have access to the encryption keys, repelling attacks. As 
a result, this ingenious technology does not permit anyone
, even the owner of the machine who can modify the code 
arbitrarily, to peek at the contents of the enclave or to 
modify execution within an enclave. Further, the SGX 
hardware enables remote attestation, that is, the ability 
to prove to a remote computer that a given enclave is 
running a particular software distribution. In essence, 
the chip is able to issue a statement that says "I 
guarantee to any remote party that I am running this code 
with this particular hash," which is a critical 
bootstrapping mechanism. Teechan is built on these two 
underlying features, which, together, provide a trusted 
execution environment (TEE).

<span xsmall>Schnorr</span>
- cryptosystem powering Bitcoin
- elliptic curve implementation
- more optimal and secure design schemes 
- Extracted from @[https://ripple.com/dev-blog/curves-with-a-twist/]
  ...  After months of analysis and testing, we’ve concluded 
  that a Schnorr-based cryptosystem will greatly enhance the
  security, flexibility, and performance of the Ripple protocol
  (when compared to Koblitz curves with secp256k1 parameters and
  ECDSA signatures as defined in :
  Standards for Efficient Cryptography
  @[http://www.secg.org/collateral/sec2_final.pdf]

- Summary of advantages versus secp256k1:

- Large absolute value</a> for the CM field discriminant 
 (large |D| )—although there is no evidence of security problems with small |D| 
@[http://safecurves.cr.yp.to/disc.html]
- Supports simple, fast, <a href="http://safecurves.cr.yp.to/complete.html">complete</a>
  constant-time single-scalar multiplication using 
  <a href="http://safecurves.cr.yp.to/ladder.html">a Montgomery ladder</a>.
- A random curve point can be represented in a way that's 
  <a href="http://safecurves.cr.yp.to/ind.html">indistinguishable from random data</a>.
- Faster performance
- ...  Our initial tests and analysis suggest ...
  Curve25519 halves verification time versus secp256k1 based on efficient implementations
  of both curves.
  - These results were achieved with lower variance, which point to the constant time
    properties of Curve25519.
  - the default signature format for Ed25519 allows batch signature verification,
    which&nbsp;promises twice the performance of DSA.
  Benchmarking:
  - <a href="http://justmoon.github.io/curvebench/benchmark.html">Raw test results</a>
  - <a href="https://github.com/justmoon/curvebench">Benchmark source code</a>

  - the new curve implementation is expected to quadruple performance versus secp256k1 
    based on our preliminary benchmarking.

- Extracted from @[https://www.mail-archive.com/cypherpunks@cpunks.org/msg02419.html]
  sums up the benefits of Schnorr as follows:
  "simple blinding, compact multi-sig, clearer security proofs, better security margin,
   less dependence on hash properties."

Summary of advantages versus ECDSA:
  - Simpler to securely implement
  - Composable threshold signatures without multi-party computation
  - Verification happens off-network allowing for sophisticated functionality without increasing network load or complexity
  - Conducive to highly distributed systems
  - Less constraints allows for more optimal and secure design schemes

  - DSA schemes are difficult to manage because the schemes are easy to get wrong.
    An improper implementations is trivial to break, and what might seem like a minor
    misstep can precipitate a system-wide vulnerability—as demonstrated by 
    @[http://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2012/10/25/sony-ps3-hacked-for-good-master-keys-revealed/]
    ...  Hackers were able to access full control of the PS3 employing "simple algebra" after Sony
    set a constant in its custom DSA implementation instead of a randomly generated number. 
    The sensitivity of DSA signatures to human error allowed this single oversight to fully
    compromise the console's encryption protections, exposing the platform and Sony's partners
    to the perpetual threat of piracy.
  - Alternatively, Schnorr signatures are more forgiving and simpler to implement because its
    security is inherently more robust based on the scheme’s dynamic hash function
  @[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?reload=true&amp;arnumber=4908440]
    The ephemeral public value r is tightly bound to the message, which means that the security
    of the scheme is no longer dependent on the collision resistance of the hash function.
  @[http://www.cs.bris.ac.uk/Publications/pub_master.jsp?id=2001023]

  - Independent verification and combining:
    Another advantage of Schnorr is related to threshold signatures 
  - ECDSA can create threshold signatures, but requires multi-party computation
   @[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_multi-party_computation]
    This means that the number of participants required to generate a signature
    without revealing their secrets is twice the number of shares required to recover the key.
    - In contrast, Schnorr has no such restriction. Shares of a signature can be independently
      verified and then composed.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ElGamal_encryption

In cryptography, the ElGamal encryption system is an asymmetric key encryption algorithm for public-key cryptography which is based on the Diffie–Hellman key exchange. The system provides an additional layer of security by asymmetrically encrypting keys previously used for symmetric message encryption. It was described by Taher Elgamal in 1985.[1] ElGamal encryption is used in the free GNU Privacy Guard software, recent versions of PGP, and other cryptosystems. The Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) is a variant of the ElGamal signature scheme, which should not be confused with ElGamal encryption.

RSA
RSA encryption and decryption are commutative
hence it may be used directly as a digital signature scheme
given an RSA scheme {(e,R), (d,p,q)}
to sign a message M, compute:
S = M power d (mod R)
to verify a signature, compute:
M = S power e(mod R) = M power e.d(mod R) = M(mod R)

RSA can be used both for encryption and digital signatures, simply by reversing the order in which the exponents are used: the secret exponent (d) to create the signature, the public exponent (e) for anyone to verify the signature. Everything else is identical.

DSA (Digital Signature Algorithm)
DSA is a variant on the ElGamal and Schnorr algorithms creates a 320 bit signature, but with 512-1024 bit security security again rests on difficulty of computing discrete logarithms has been quite widely accepted

DSA Key Generation
firstly shared global public key values (p,q,g) are chosen:
choose a large prime p = 2 power L
where L= 512 to 1024 bits and is a multiple of 64
choose q, a 160 bit prime factor of p-1
choose g = h power (p-1)/q
for any h1
then each user chooses a private key and computes their public key:
choose x compute y = g power x(mod p)

DSA key generation is related to, but somewhat more complex than El Gamal. Mostly because of the use of the secondary 160-bit modulus q used to help speed up calculations and reduce the size of the resulting signature.

DSA Signature Creation and Verification

to sign a message M
generate random signature key k, k compute
r = (g power k(mod p))(mod q)
s = k-1.SHA(M)+ x.r (mod q)
send signature (r,s) with message

to verify a signature, compute:
w = s-1(mod q)
u1= (SHA(M).w)(mod q)
u2= r.w(mod q)
v = (g power u1.y power u2(mod p))(mod q)
if v=r then the signature is verified

Signature creation is again similar to ElGamal with the use of a per message temporary signature key k, but doing calc first mod p, then mod q to reduce the size of the result. Note that the use of the hash function SHA is explicit here. Verification also consists of comparing two computations, again being a bit more complex than, but related to El Gamal.
Note that nearly all the calculations are mod q, and hence are much faster.
But, In contrast to RSA, DSA can be used only for digital signatures

DSA Security
The presence of a subliminal channel exists in many schemes (any that need a random number to be chosen), not just DSA. It emphasises the need for "system security", not just a good algorithm.

DMARC is a protocol that helps protect the integrity and authenticity of email. DMARC is not a single technology but rather is a combination of several components, including the Sender Policy Framework (SPF) and Domain Keys Identified Email (DKIM), to help verify email authenticity. There are also different levels of DMARC policies. The "p=none" policy enables organizations to monitor their email systems for senders, while the "p=reject" policy will block non-compliant messages completely. BOD 18-01 mandates the use of the p=reject policy by Oct. 16.

DSS (Digital Signature Services) is an open-source software library for 
electronic signature creation and validation. DSS supports the creation and 
verification of interoperable and secure electronic signatures in line with 
European legislation. In particular, DSS aims to follow the eIDAS Regulation 
and related standards closely .

DSS can be re-used in an IT solution for electronic signatures to ensure that 
signatures are created and verified in line with European legislation and 
standards. DSS allows re-use in a variety of different ways: in an applet, in 
a stand-alone application or in a server application. DSS can also be used as 
a reference implementation for IT solutions which do not directly re-use it. 
Demos are also available to assist the use of DSS as a reference implementation.


The library, realised in Java, is open-source, available to all Member States
, businesses and citizens for re-use in electronic signature solutions. It is 
continuously updated and maintained to anticipate and follow developments in 
regulations and standards. 

Anyone can integrate it and redistribute it under the terms of the Lesser 
General Public License (LGPL 2.1).

In accordance with ETSI standards, DSS supports various document and 
signature formats including PAdES, XAdES, CAdES and ASiC and is compliant 
with Implementing Decision 2015/1506/EU. A “cook-book” is also provided with 
documentation targeting implementers/developers and aiming at facilitating 
the integration and use of DSS in their applications.

https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/11223/proof-of-authenticity-without-microchips/11225#11225 


CPU based

Modern embedded CPUs, e.g. ARM ones, may have "security enclave" or "trust zone" directly on System on chip (SoC) or as an external chip. They have a section of a chip that is locked down during manufacturing with some specific hardware keys. The keys are impossible to extract out from the chip.

The fool proof path would be here to have a security enclave enablde microchip that contains a private key set during the manufacturing. The private key never leaves the device. Instead, the chip reports the public key back to the inventory management system at the end of the production line when the item has been manufactured.

When the item changes owners the associated transaction is made to a blockchain. This transaction is signed with the embedded CPU and its private key and the transaction contains the id of old owner and the id of the new owner (either names, public keys, etc.)

Security enclave enabled chips are expensive. However if you do not have security process your foundation right nothing stops the copying of private keys and causing a mess.

NFC based

Near field communication chips, also known as RFID tags, have some cryptography and authentication built into them. It is in theory possible to have an NFC chip attached to your item and then you can do a blockchain transaction by touching the chip with your NFC enabled Android smartphone and special app that does the transaction.

However I am not aware of NFC chips that would do ECDSA signing that is the base of all known blockchain transactions currently. Mostly NFC chip based security is designed to protect the traffic between the chip and the reader for eavesdropping and they use symmetric ciphers. Someone with better, up-to-date, information can correct me if I am wrong here.
